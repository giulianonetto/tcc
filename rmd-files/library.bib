abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

This work describes, through examples, a simple way to carry out experimental design calculations applying an spreadsheets. The aim of this tutorial is to introduce an alternative to sophisticated commercial programs that normally are too complex in data input and output. An overview of the principal methods is also briefly presented. The spreadsheets are suitable to handle different types of computations such as screening procedures applying factorial design and the optimization procedure based on response surface methodology. Furthermore, the spreadsheets are sufficiently versatile to be adapted to specific experimental designs.

abstract = {The lack of a method for demonstrating the presence of Treponema pallidum by growth necessitates the use of alternative methods. Traditionally, these methods are divided into direct detection methods (animal inoculation, dark-field microscopy, etc.) and serologic tests for the presence of patient antibody against T. pallidum. Serologic methods are further divided into two classes. One class, the nontreponemal tests, detects antibodies to lipoidal antigens present in either the host or T. pallidum; examples are the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma reagin and tests. Reactivity in these tests generally indicates host tissue damage that may not be specific for syphilis. Because these tests are easy and inexpensive to perform, they are commonly used for screening, and with proper clinical signs they are suggestive of syphilis. The other class of test, the treponemal tests, uses specific treponemal antigens. Confirmation of infection requires a reactive treponemal test. Examples of the treponemal tests are the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. These tests are more expensive and complicated to perform than the nontreponemal tests. On the horizon are a number of direct antigen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PCR techniques. Several of these techniques have shown promise in clinical trials for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis that are presently difficult to diagnose.},

These chimeric nucleases are composed of programmable, sequence-specific DNA-binding modules linked to a nonspecific DNA cleavage domain. ZFNs and TALENs enable a broad range of genetic modifications by inducing DNA double-strand breaks that stimulate error-prone nonhomologous end joining or homology-directed repair at specific genomic locations. Here, we review achievements made possible by site-specific nuclease technologies and discuss applications of these reagents for genetic analysis and manipulation. In addition, we highlight the therapeutic potential of ZFNs and TALENs and discuss future prospects for the field, including the emergence of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas-based RNA-guided DNA endonucleases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {T helper 9 (Th9) cells contribute to lung inflammation and allergy as sources of interleukin-9 (IL-9). However, the mechanisms by which IL-9/Th9 mediate immunopathology in the lung are unknown. Here we report an IL-9-driven positive feedback loop that reinforces allergic inflammation. We show that IL-9 increases IL-2 production by mast cells, which leads to expansion of CD25+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and subsequent activation of Th9 cells. Blocking IL-9 or inhibiting CD117 (c-Kit) signalling counteracts the pathogenic effect of the described IL-9-mast cell-IL-2 signalling axis. Overproduction of IL-9 is observed in expectorates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and a sex-specific variant of IL-9 is predictive of allergic reactions in female patients. Our results suggest that blocking IL-9 may be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate inflammation associated with microbial colonization in the lung, and offers a plausible explanation for gender differences in clinical outcomes of patients with CF.},

abstract = {Members of the MMP family function in various processes of innate immunity, particularly in controlling important steps in leukocyte trafficking and activation. MMP28 (epilysin) is a member of this family of proteinases, and we have found that MMP28 is expressed by macrophages and regulates their recruitment to the lung. We hypothesized that MMP28 regulates other key macrophage responses, such as macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these MMP28-dependent changes in macrophage polarization would alter fibrotic responses in the lung. We examined the gene expression changes in WT and Mmp28-/- BMDMs, stimulated with LPS or IL-4/IL-13 to promote M1 and M2 cells, respectively. We also collected macrophages from the lungs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-exposed WT and Mmp28-/- mice to evaluate changes in macrophage polarization. Lastly, we evaluated the macrophage polarization phenotypes during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in WT and Mmp28-/- mice and assessed mice for differences in weight loss and total collagen levels. We found that MMP28 dampens proinflammatory macrophage function and promots M2 programming. In both in vivo models, we found deficits in M2 polarization in Mmp28-/- mice. In bleomycin-induced lung injury, these changes were associated with reduced fibrosis. MMP28 is an important regulator of macrophage polarization, promoting M2 function. Loss of MMP28 results in reduced M2 polarization and protection from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. These findings highlight a novel role for MMP28 in macrophage biology and pulmonary disease.},

abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: The molecular mechanisms underlying acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are poorly understood. We studied the global gene expression signature of acute exacerbations of IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To understand the gene expression patterns of acute exacerbations of IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: RNA was extracted from 23 stable IPF lungs, 8 IPF lungs with acute exacerbation (IPF-AEx), and 15 control lungs and used for hybridization on Agilent gene expression microarrays. Functional analysis of genes was performed with Spotfire and Genomica. Gene validations for MMP1, MMP7, AGER, DEFA1-3, COL1A2, and CCNA2 were performed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling assays were performed on the same tissues used for the microarray. ELISA for alpha-defensins was performed on plasma from control subjects, patients with stable IPF, and patients with IPF-AEx.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in IPF-AEx and IPF samples were similar for the genes that distinguish IPF from control lungs. Five hundred and seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate {\textless} 5{\%}) between stable IPF and IPF-AEx. Functional analysis of these genes did not indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes. CCNA2 and alpha-defensin protein levels were also higher and localized to the epithelium of IPF-AEx, where widespread apoptosis was also detected. alpha-Defensin protein levels were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF-AEx.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPF-AEx is characterized by enhanced epithelial injury and proliferation, as reflected by increases in CCNA2 and alpha-defensins and apoptosis of epithelium. The concomitant increase in alpha-defensins in the peripheral blood and lungs may suggest their use as biomarkers for this disorder.},

Although atopic asthma has a substantial T(H)2 cell component, the disease is notoriously heterogeneous, and recent evidence has suggested that other T cells also contribute to the development of asthma. Here, we discuss the roles of different T cell subsets in the allergic lung, consider how each subset can contribute to the development of allergic pathology and evaluate how we might manipulate these cells for new asthma therapies.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND$\backslash$nThe risk of pulmonary edema is the main limiting factor in fluid therapy in the critically ill. Interstitial edema is a subclinical step that precedes alveolar edema. This study assesses a bedside tool for detecting interstitial edema, lung ultrasound. The A-line is a horizontal artifact indicating a normal lung surface. The B-line is a kind of comet-tail artifact indicating subpleural interstitial edema. The relationship between anterior interstitial edema detected by lung ultrasound and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) value was investigated. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD$\backslash$nWe performed a prospective study in medicosurgical ICUs of university-affiliated teaching hospitals. We enrolled 102 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients who all underwent pulmonary artery catheterization. We defined A-predominance as a majority of anterior A-lines and B-predominance as a majority of anterior B-lines. These patterns were correlated with PAOP. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nFor diagnosing PAOP ≤ 13 mm Hg, A-predominance had 90{\%} specificity, 67{\%} sensitivity, 91{\%} positive predictive value, and 65{\%} negative predictive value.

Specific to predicting a low PAOP value, A-predominance suggests that fluid may be given without initial concern for the development of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. B-predominance indicates interstitial syndrome, which is usually related to interstitial edema. B-predominance is observed in a wide range of PAOP values, precluding conclusions about the need for fluid therapy. This bedside potential will be appreciated by those intensivists who envision fluid therapy based on low PAOP values and who consider that using the concept of a safety factor provided by lung ultrasound is logical.},

Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology. Interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ plays an important role in inflammation and has been associated with fibrotic remodelling. We investigated the balance between IL-1$\beta$ and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum as well as the influence of genetic variability in the IL1B and IL1RN gene on disease susceptibility and cytokine levels. In 77 IPF patients and 349 healthy controls, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL1RN and IL1B genes were determined. Serum and BALF IL-1Ra and IL-1$\beta$ levels were measured using a multiplex suspension bead array system and were correlated with genotypes. Both in serum and BALF a significantly decreased IL-1Ra/IL-1$\beta$ ratio was found in IPF patients compared to healthy controls. In the IL1RN gene, one SNP was associated with both the susceptibility to IPF and reduced IL-1Ra/IL-1$\beta$ ratios in BALF. Our results show that genetic variability in the IL1RN gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF and that this role may be more important than thought until recently. The imbalance between IL-1Ra and IL-1$\beta$ might contribute to a proinflammatory and pro-fibrotic environment in their lungs.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Although the GAP model is useful for predicting mortality, survivals have not yet been validated for each GAP score. We aimed to elucidate how prognosis is related to GAP score and GAP stage in IPF patients. Methods: The Korean Interstitial Lung Disease Study Group conducted a national survey to evaluate various characteristics in IPF patients from 2003 to 2007. Patients were diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria of the ATS/ERS. We enrolled 1,685 patients with IPF; 1,262 had undergone DLCO measurement. Patients were stratified based on GAP score (0–7): GAP scoreGroup 0(n= 26), Group 1 (n=150), Group 2 (n=208), Group 3 (n=376), Group 4 (n= 317), Group 5 (n=138), Group 6(n= 39), and Group 7 (n=8). Results: Higher GAP score and GAP stage were associated with a poorer prognosis (p{\textless} 0.001, respectively). Survival time in Group 3 was lower than those in Groups 1 and 2 (p=0.043 and p=0.039, respectively), and higher than those in groups 4, 5, and 6 (p=0.043, p=0.032, and p= 0.003, respectively). Gender, age, and DLCO ({\%}) differed significantly between Groups 2 and 3. All four variables in the GAP model differed significantly between Groups 3 and 4. Conclusion: The GAP system showed significant predictive ability for mortality in IPF patients. However, prognosis in IPF patients with a GAP score of 3 were significantly different from those in the other stage I groups and stage II groups of Asian patients.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4{\%} and 83.4+8{\%} in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value {\textgreater} 0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value {\textgreater} 0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value {\textgreater} 0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The ex vivo finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.},

abstract = {Type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) play a pivotal role in helminthic infection and allergic disorders. CD4(+) T cells which produce type 2 cytokines can be generated via IL-4-dependent and -independent pathways. Although the IL-4-dependent pathway is well documented, factors that drive IL-4-independent Th2 cell differentiation remain obscure. We report here that the new cytokine IL-33, in the presence of Ag, polarizes murine and human naive CD4(+) T cells into a population of T cells which produce mainly IL-5 but not IL-4. This polarization requires IL-1R-related molecule and MyD88 but not IL-4 or STAT6. The IL-33-induced T cell differentiation is also dependent on the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-kappaB but not the induction of GATA3 or T-bet. In vivo, ST2(-/-) mice developed attenuated airway inflammation and IL-5 production in a murine model of asthma. Conversely, IL-33 administration induced the IL-5-producing T cells and exacerbated allergen-induced airway inflammation in wild-type as well as IL-4(-/-) mice. Finally, adoptive transfer of IL-33-polarized IL-5(+)IL-4(-)T cells triggered airway inflammation in naive IL-4(-/-) mice. Thus, we demonstrate here that, in the presence of Ag, IL-33 induces IL-5-producing T cells and promotes airway inflammation independent of IL-4.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and variable clinical course. Although matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is emerging as an important IPF biomarker, reproducibility across studies is unclear. We aimed to determine whether a previously reported prognostic threshold for MMP-7 was predictive of mortality in an independent cohort of IPF patients. METHODS MMP-7 concentrations obtained from heparinized plasma samples were determined by ELISA in 97 patients with IPF and 41 healthy controls. The association of the previously published heparin plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL with all-cause mortality or transplant-free survival (TFS) was determined, either as an independent biomarker or as part of the modified personal clinical and molecular mortality index (m-PCMI). RESULTS MMP-7 plasma concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to healthy controls (14.40 ± 6.55 ng/mL vs 6.03 ± 2.51 ng/mL, P {\textless} 0.001). The plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality and TFS (unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) = 25.85 and 15.49, 95{\%} CI: 10.91-61.23 and 5.41-44.34, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). MMP-7 concentrations, split by 12.1 ng/mL, were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) predictive of mortality and TFS after adjusting for age, gender, smoking and baseline pulmonary function parameters, in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. MMP-7 concentrations were negatively correlated with diffusing lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO ) (r = -0.21, P = 0.02), and positively with a mortality risk scoring system (GAP) that combines age, gender, forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO (r = 0.32, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This study confirms that MMP-7 concentrations could be used to accurately predict outcomes across cohorts and centres, when similar collection protocols are applied.},

A subset of patients develops significant pulmonary fibrosis, identified either on biopsy or radiologically. The term chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis (CFPA) has been suggested.Methods: We describe 11 patients with CFPA referred to our centre.Results: Mean age was 58.5 years and five were male. In nine, fibrosis was already evident on presentation, while in two it developed 3 and 6 years later. The predominant radiological feature was extensive or complete involvement of the entire lung, with minimal contralateral involvement. All patients received prolonged antifungal treatment. Two patients had surgical treatment; both developed post-operative complications. The contralateral lung remained free of significant disease in all but three patients.Conclusions: CFPA is a rare complication of CPA that is usually evident on presentation, but may develop after years in patients not on antifungals.

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is the pathologic basis for a variety of incurable human chronic lung diseases. IL-17A, a glycoprotein secreted from IL-17–producing cells, has recently been shown to be a proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammation and autoimmune disease. In this study, we report that IL-17A increased the synthesis and secretion of collagen and promoted the epithelial–mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells in a TGF-b1–dependent manner. Using in vivo fibrotic models, we found IL-17A expression to be elevated and IL-17A–associated signaling pathways to be activated in fibrotic lung tissues. Neutralization of IL-17A in vivo promoted the resolution of bleomycin-induced acute inflammation, attenuated pulmonary fibrosis, and increased survival. Additionally, IL-17A antagonism inhibited silica-induced chronic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting IL-17A resulted in a shift of the suppressive immune response in fibrotic lung tissue toward a Th1-type immune response, and it effectively induced autophagy, which promoted the autophagic degradation of collagen and autophagy-associated cell death. Moreover, IL-17A was found to attenuate the starvation-induced autophagy, and autophagy modulators regulated collagen degradation in the alveolar epithelial cells in a TGF-b1–independent manner. Administration of 3-methylamphetamine, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the therapeutic efficacy of IL-17A antagonism in pulmonary fibrosis. Our studies indicate that IL-17A participates in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both TGF-b1–dependent and –independent manners and that the components of the IL-17A signaling pathway are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of fibroproliferative lung diseases.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Differences in the lung microbial community influence idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progression. Whether the lung microbiome influences IPF host defense remains unknown. OBJECTIVES To explore the host immune response and microbial interaction in IPF as they relate to progression-free survival (PFS), fibroblast function, and leukocyte phenotypes. METHODS Paired microarray gene expression data derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data from bronchoalveolar lavage obtained as part of the COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with Biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-Progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) study were used to conduct association pathway analyses. The responsiveness of paired lung fibroblasts to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulation by CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) was integrated into microbiome-gene expression association analyses for a subset of individuals. The relationship between associated pathways and circulating leukocyte phenotypes was explored by flow cytometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Down-regulation of immune response pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, Toll-, and RIG1-like receptor pathways, was associated with worse PFS. Ten of the 11 PFS-associated pathways correlated with microbial diversity and individual genus, with species accumulation curve richness as a hub. Higher species accumulation curve richness was significantly associated with inhibition of NODs and TLRs, whereas increased abundance of Streptococcus correlated with increased NOD-like receptor signaling. In a network analysis, expression of up-regulated signaling pathways was strongly associated with decreased abundance of operational taxonomic unit 1341 (OTU1341; Prevotella) among individuals with fibroblasts responsive to CpG-ODN stimulation. The expression of TLR signaling pathways was also linked to CpG-ODN responsive fibroblasts, OTU1341 (Prevotella), and Shannon index of microbial diversity in a network analysis. Lymphocytes expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 CD8 significantly correlated with OTU1348 (Staphylococcus). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that host-microbiome interactions influence PFS and fibroblast responsiveness.},

abstract = {Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissue or organ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of proteases known to regulate the turn-over of ECM and so they are suggested to be important in tissue remodelling observed during fibrogenic process associated with chronic inflammation. Tissue remodelling is the result of an imbalance in the equilibrium of the normal processes of synthesis and degradation of ECM components markedly controlled by the MMPs/TIMP imbalance. We previously showed an association of the differences in collagen deposition in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with a reduced molar pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. Using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) preclinical model of liver fibrosis in mice, we observed a significant increase in collagen deposition with increased expression and release of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 both at 24 h and 3 weeks later. This suggests an early altered regulation of matrix turnover involved in the development of fibrosis. We also demonstrated an activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway associated with the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling in the development of experimental fibrosis both in lung and liver. This was also associated with an increased expression of purinergic receptors mainly P2X7 Finally, these observations emphasize those effective therapies for these disorders must be given early in the natural history of the disease, prior to the development of tissue remodelling and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

In lung cancer tissues, ApoE expression was more frequently found in malignant pleural effusions (MPE)-associated lung adenocarcinoma than in lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma without MPE (P{\textless} 0.05), indicating that ApoE is associated with the pathogenesis of MPE in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Next, we examined the roles of ApoE in an MPE-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line that endogenously over-expresses ApoE, PC14PE6/AS2 (AS2). In that experiment we inhibited ApoE expression by transfection of a plasmid carrying ApoE siRNAs into AS2 cells to generate AS-S2 and AS-S3 cells. Compared to vector-control cells and parental AS2 cells, AS2-S2 and AS2-S3 cells grew slower (P{\textless} 0.05), were more sensitive to cisplatin, and had significantly impaired cellular migration (P{\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, over-expression of ApoE was independently associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients who had MPE at the time of diagnosis (P{\textless} 0.001). Conclusively, ApoE over-expression promotes cancer proliferation and migration and contributes to an aggressive clinical course in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and MPE. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless} 0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

The new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated, and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are undefined.

METHODS: This is a national hospital-based cohort study conducted in Brazil with 23,894 postpartum women between 2011 and 2012. Data were obtained using interviews with postpartum women, hospital records, and prenatal care cards. All postpartum women with a reactive serological test result recorded in the prenatal care card or syphilis diagnosis during hospitalization for childbirth were considered cases of syphilis in pregnancy. The Chi-square test was used for determining the disease prevalence and testing coverage rate by region of residence, self-reported skin color, maternal age, and type of prenatal and child delivery care units. RESULTS: Prenatal care covered 98.7{\%} postpartum women. Syphilis testing coverage rate was 89.1{\%} (one test) and 41.2{\%} (two tests), and syphilis prevalence in pregnancy was 1.02{\%} (95{\%}CI 0.84;1.25). A lower prenatal coverage rate was observed among women in the North region, indigenous women, those with less education, and those who received prenatal care in public health care units. A lower testing coverage rate was observed among residents in the North, Northeast, and Midwest regions, among younger and non-white skin-color women, among those with lower education, and those who received prenatal care in public health care units. An increased prevalence of syphilis was observed among women with {\textless} 8 years of education (1.74{\%}), who self-reported as black (1.8{\%}) or mixed (1.2{\%}), those who did not receive prenatal care (2.5{\%}), and those attending public (1.37{\%}) or mixed (0.93{\%}) health care units.},

abstract = {Organ fibrosis, the result of exaggerated, persistent, and often irreversible accumulation of extracellular matrix, complicates numerous diseases in all organs and tissues and has particularly serious consequences in the lungs. Abnormally accumulating scar tissue both replaces normally functioning parenchyma and distorts the architecture of unaffected tissue. In the lungs, the fibrotic process often leads to rapid and severe abnormalities in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange properties. There is no confirmed cure, and better therapies are required for treating fibrosis. The development of therapeutic strategies compels a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis, which are diverse, complex, and redundant. Epithelial injury, oxidative stress, coagulation disturbances, and inflammation are engaged in a complex interplay leading to augmented transformation of several cell types into myofibroblasts and prolonged survival of these extracellular matrix-producing cells. Cytokines are centrally engaged in the homeostatic and pathophysiologic regulation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it appears that identical cytokines are utilized by inflammation, profibrotic mechanisms, and the fibrotic process itself, suggesting that specific targeting or utilization of these cytokines holds therapeutic promise. In this article, we review the wealth of recent knowledge on major cytokines involved in the fibrotic process.},

As in humans, monocytes in the mouse comprise two phenotypically distinct subsets that are Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) and Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high), respectively. The question remains whether these populations contribute differentially to the generation of peripheral mononuclear phagocytes. In this study, we track the fate of adoptively transferred, fractionated monocyte subsets in the lung of recipient mice. We show that under inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions, both monocyte subsets give rise to pulmonary dendritic cells. In contrast, under the conditions studied, only Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high) monocytes, but not Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) cells, had the potential to differentiate into lung macrophages. However, Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) monocytes could acquire this potential upon conversion into Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high) cells. Our results therefore indicate an intrinsic dichotomy in the differentiation potential of the two main blood monocyte subsets.},

abstract = {Many diseases accompanied by chronic inflammation are connected with dysregulated activation of macrophage subpopulations. Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO2-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1–5 min) experiments. We discovered that NO2-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO2-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO2-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO2-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO2-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO2-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.},

abstract = {Macrophage-specific expression of Arginase-1 is commonly believed to promote inflammation, fibrosis, and wound healing by enhancing L-proline, polyamine, and Th2 cytokine production. Here, however, we show that macrophage-specific Arg1 functions as an inhibitor of inflammation and fibrosis following infection with the Th2-inducing pathogen Schistosoma mansoni. Although susceptibility to infection was not affected by the conditional deletion of Arg1 in macrophages, Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice died at an accelerated rate. The mortality was not due to acute Th1/NOS2-mediated hepatotoxicity or endotoxemia. Instead, granulomatous inflammation, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension increased in infected Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice. Similar findings were obtained with Arg1(flox/flox);Tie2cre mice, which delete Arg1 in all macrophage populations. Production of Th2 cytokines increased in the infected Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice, and unlike alternatively activated wild-type macrophages, Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre macrophages failed to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro, providing an underlying mechanism for the exacerbated Th2 pathology. The suppressive activity of Arg1-expressing macrophages was independent of IL-10 and TGF-beta1. However, when exogenous L-arginine was provided, T cell proliferation was restored, suggesting that Arg1-expressing macrophages deplete arginine, which is required to sustain CD4(+) T cell responses. These data identify Arg1 as the essential suppressive mediator of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) and demonstrate that Arg1-expressing macrophages function as suppressors rather than inducers of Th2-dependent inflammation and fibrosis.},

Although -CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes (CCR2⁺Mo) and their derivatives initiate adaptive pulmonary immune responses, their role in coordinating innate immune responses in the lung remain poorly defined. Using conditional and antibody-mediated cell ablation strategies, we found that CCR2⁺Mo and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) are essential for innate defense against inhaled conidia. By harnessing fluorescent Aspergillus reporter (FLARE) conidia that report fungal cell association and viability in vivo, we identify two mechanisms by which CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs exert innate antifungal activity. First, CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs condition the lung inflammatory milieu to augment neutrophil conidiacidal activity. Second, conidial uptake by CCR2⁺Mo temporally coincided with their differentiation into Mo-DCs, a process that resulted in direct conidial killing. Our findings illustrate both indirect and direct functions for CCR2⁺Mo and their derivatives in innate antifungal immunity in the lung.},

abstract = {Inflammation is an immune response triggered by microbial invasion and/or tissue injury. While acute inflammation is directed toward invading pathogens and injured cells, thus enabling tissue regeneration, chronic inflammation can lead to severe pathologies and tissue dysfunction. These processes are linked with macrophage polarization into specific inflammatory "M1-like" or regulatory "M2-like" subsets. Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), produced endogenously as byproducts of metabolism and oxidative inflammatory conditions, may be useful for treating diseases associated with dysregulated immune homeostasis. The goal of this study was to characterize the role of nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) in regulating the functional specialization of macrophages induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4, and to reveal specific signaling mechanisms which can account for OA-NO2-dependent modulation of inflammation and fibrotic responses. Our results show that OA-NO2inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of both pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines (including transforming growth factor-$\beta$) and inhibits nitric oxide and superoxide anion production. OA-NO2also decreases interleukin-4-induced macrophage responses by inhibiting arginase-I expression and transforming growth factor-$\beta$ production. These effects are mediated via downregulation of signal transducers and activators of transcription, mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kB signaling responses. Finally, OA-NO2inhibits fibrotic processes in an in vivo model of angiotensin II-induced myocardial fibrosis by attenuating expression of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin, systemic transforming growth factor-$\beta$ levels and infiltration of both "M1-" and "M2-like" macrophage subsets into afflicted tissue. Overall, the electrophilic fatty acid derivative OA-NO2modulates a broad range of "M1-" and "M2-like" macrophage functions and represents a potential therapeutic approach to target diseases associated with dysregulated macrophage subsets.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease. Antiinflammatory therapies, including corticosteroids, are of no benefit. The role of monocytes and macrophages is therefore controversial.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To define the role of monocytes and macrophages during lung fibrogenesis and resolution, and explore the phenotype of the cells involved.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used multiple in vivo depletional strategies, backed up by adoptive transfer techniques. Further studies were performed on samples from patients with IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Depletion of lung macrophages during fibrogenesis reduced pulmonary fibrosis as measured by lung collagen (P = 0.0079); fibrosis score (P = 0.0051); and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for surrogate markers of fibrosis Col1 (P = 0.0083) and a-smooth muscle actin (P = 0.0349). There was an associated reduction in markers of the profibrotic alternative macrophage activation phenotype, Ym1 (P = 0.0179), and Arginase 1. The alternative macrophage marker CD163 was expressed on lung macrophages from patients with IPF. Depletion of Ly6Chi circulating monocytes reduced pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.0052) and the number of Ym1- positive alternatively activated lung macrophages (P = 0.0310). Their adoptive transfer during fibrogenesis exacerbated fibrosis (P = 0.0304); however, adoptively transferred CD45.1 Ly6Chi cells were not found in the lungs of recipient CD45.2 mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of circulating monocytes and lung macrophages during pulmonary fibrosis, and emphasize the importance of the alternatively activated macrophage phenotype. We show that Ly6Chi monocytes facilitate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, but are not obviously engrafted into lungs thereafter. Finally, we provide empirical data to suggest that macrophages may have a resolution-promoting role during the reversible phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.},

Several clinical disorders can precipitate ARDS, including pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, and major trauma. Physiologically, ARDS is characterized by increased permeability pulmonary edema, severe arterial hypoxemia, and impaired carbon dioxide excretion. Based on both experimental and clinical studies, progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis and the resolution of lung injury, including the contribution of environmental and genetic factors. Improved sur- vival has been achieved with the use of lung-protective ventilation. Future progress will depend on developing novel therapeutics that can facilitate and enhance lung repair.},

abstract = {T helper 1 responses are typically proinflammatory, while Th2 responses have been considered regulatory. Interestingly, Th2 responses characterize a number of pulmonary diseases, many of which terminate in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. We developed a mouse model using Schistosoma mansoni eggs and cytokine-deficient mice to induce highly polarized Th1- or Th2-type inflammation in the lung. In this study, we examined the pathology and cytokine profiles in Th1- and Th2-polarized environments and used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to decipher the genes responsible for these effects. We further elaborated on the results using IL-10- and IL-13-deficient mice because these cytokines are believed to be the central regulators of Th2-associated pathology. We found that the Th1-polarized mice developed small granulomas with less fibrosis while expressing genes characteristic of tissue damage. Th2-polarized mice, in contrast, formed large granulomas with massive collagen deposition and up-regulated genes associated-with wound healing, specifically, arginase, collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMP. In addition, several members of the chitinase-like family were up-regulated in the lung following egg challenge. We also developed a method of defining the net collagen deposition using the expression profiles of several collagen, MMP, and tissue inhibitors of MMP genes. We found that Th1-polarized mice did not elaborate collagens or MMPs and therefore did not have a significant capacity for repair in this model. Thus, Th1-mediated inflammation is characterized by tissue damage, while Th2 directs wound healing and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Macrophages play essential activities in homeostasis maintenance during different organism's conditions. They may be polarized according to various stimuli, which subsequently subdivide them into distinct populations. Macrophages with inflammatory activity function mainly during pathological context, while those with regulatory activity control inflammation and also remodel the repairing process. Here, we propose to review and to present a concise discuss on the role of different components during tissue repair, including those related to innate immune receptors and metabolic modifications. The scar formation is directly related to the degree of inflammation, but also with the appearance of M2 macrophages. In spite of greater numbers of macrophages in the fibrotic phase, regulatory macrophages present some characteristics related to promotion of fibrosis but also with the control of scar formation. These regulatory macrophages present an oxidative metabolism, and differ from the initial inflammatory macrophages, which in turn, present a glycolytic characteristic, which allow regulatory ones to optimize the oxygen consumption and minimizing their ROS production. We will emphasize the difference in macrophage subpopulations and the origin and plasticity of these cells during fibrotic processes.},

abstract = {Activated macrophages have been characterized as M1 and M2 according to their inflammatory response pattern. Here we analyzed the M2 marker expression and intracellular signal transduction in the course of cytokine-driven differentiation. We found elevated spontaneous production of the chemokines CCL17, CCL18 and CCL22 and increased expression of CD206 by alveolar macrophages from patients with lung fibrosis. Stimulation of normal human AM with Th2 cytokines IL-4 and/or IL-10 in vitro revealed IL-4 as the most powerful inducer of M2-phenotype in AM and monocytes. Importantly, IL-10 enhanced IL-4-induced expression of CCL18 and IL-1RA in a synergistic fashion. IL-4/IL-10 stimulation induces a strong activation of STAT3 in AM from fibrosis patients. These results suggest an important role for M2 polarized AM in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and indicate that both IL-4 and IL-10 account for human AM phenotype shift to M2, as seen in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, a subset of patients has a short duration of symptoms with rapid progression to end-stage disease. In this study, we evaluated clinical and molecular features of "rapid" and "slow" progressors with IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: 26 patients with {\textless}6 months of symptoms before first presentation [rapid progressors] and 88 patients with {\textgreater}24 months of symptoms [slow progressors] were studied. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meyer method and proportional hazard's model. Lung microarrays and tissue proteins were measured in a subset of patients. No differences were found in age, physiologic impairment and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular profile. There were more males (OR = 6.5; CI:1.4-29.5; p = 0.006) and smokers (OR = 3.04; CI:1.1-8.3; p = 0.04) in the rapid progressors group. Survival from the beginning of symptoms was significantly reduced in rapid progressors (HR = 9.0; CI:4.48-18.3; p{\textless}0.0001) and there was a tendency for decreased survival from the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.5; CI:0.81-2.87; p = 0.18). We identified 437 differentially expressed genes. Lungs of rapid progressors overexpressed genes involved in morphogenesis, oxidative stress, migration/proliferation, and genes from fibroblasts/smooth muscle cells. Upregulation of two of these genes, adenosine-2B receptor and prominin-1/CD133, was validated by immunohistochemistry and were expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. BAL from rapid progressors showed a {\textgreater}2-fold increase of active matrix metalloproteinase-9, and induced a higher fibroblast migration compared with slow progressors and controls [238+/-98{\%} versus 123+/-29{\%} (p{\textless}0.05) and 30+/-17{\%} (p{\textless}0.01)].$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A subgroup of IPF patients, predominantly smoking males, display an accelerated clinical course and have a gene expression pattern that is different from those with slower progression and longer survival. These findings highlight the variability in the progression of IPF, and may explain, in part, the difficulty in obtaining significant and reproducible results in studies of therapeutic interventions in patients with IPF.},

abstract = {Few studies have addressed the importance of vascular remodeling in the lung during the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. For fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix to occur, there must be a geometric increase in neovascularization. We hypothesized that net angiogenesis during the pathogenesis of fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis are dependent in part upon an overexpression of the angiogenic CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). To test this hypothesis, we measured MIP-2 by specific ELISA in whole lung homogenates in either bleomycin-treated or control CBA/J mice and correlated these levels with lung hydroxyproline. We found that lung tissue from mice treated with bleomycin, compared with that from saline-treated controls, demonstrated a significant increase in the presence of MIP-2 that was correlated to a greater angiogenic response and total lung hydroxyproline content. Neutralizing anti-MIP-2 Abs inhibited the angiogenic activity of day 16 bleomycin-treated lung specimens using an in vivo angiogenesis bioassay. Furthermore, when MIP-2 was depleted in vivo by passive immunization, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced without a change in the presence of pulmonary neutrophils, fibroblast proliferation, or collagen gene expression. This was also paralleled by a reduction in angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that the angiogenic CXC chemokine, MIP-2, is an important factor that regulates angiogenesis/fibrosis in pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Given the importance of monocytes in pathogenesis of infectious and other inflammatory disorders, delineating functional and phenotypic characterization of monocyte subsets has emerged as a critical requirement. Although human monocytes have been subdivided into three different populations based on surface expression of CD14 and CD16, published reports suffer from contradictions with respect to subset phenotypes and function. This has been attributed to discrepancies in reliable gating strategies for flow cytometric characterization and purification protocols contributing to significant changes in receptor expression. By using a combination of multicolour flow cytometry and a high-dimensional automated clustering algorithm to confirm robustness of gating strategy and analysis of ex-vivo activation of whole blood with LPS we demonstrate the following: a. 'Classical' monocytes are phagocytic with no inflammatory attributes, b. 'Non-classical' subtype display 'inflammatory' characteristics on activation and display properties for antigen presentation and c. 'Intermediate' subtype that constitutes a very small percentage in circulation (under physiological conditions) appear to be transitional monocytes that display both phagocytic and inflammatory function. Analysis of blood from patients with Sepsis, a pathogen driven acute inflammatory disease and Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disorder validated the broad conclusions drawn in the study.},

Distinct from the simple M1/M2 dichotomy initially proposed, extensive diversity of macrophage phenotypes have been extensively demonstrated as characteristic features of monocyte-macrophage differentiation, highlighting the difficulty of defining complex profiles by a limited number of genes. Since the description of macrophage activation is currently contentious and confusing, the generation of a simple and reliable framework to categorize major Mϕ phenotypes in the context of complex clinical conditions would be extremely relevant to unravel different roles played by these cells in pathophysiological scenarios. In the current study, we integrated transcriptome data using bioinformatics tools to generate two macrophage molecular signatures. We validated our signatures in in vitro experiments and in clinical samples. More importantly, we were able to attribute prognostic and predictive values to components of our signatures. Our study provides a framework to guide the interrogation of macrophage phenotypes in the context of health and disease. The approach described here could be used to propose new biomarkers for diagnosis in diverse clinical settings including dengue infections, asthma and sepsis resolution.},

abstract = {Background The initiation and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. IL-33, an important cytokine for respiratory diseases, is overexpressed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Objectives We aimed to determine the effects and mechanism of IL-33 on the development and severity of pulmonary fibrosis in murine bleomycin-induced fibrosis.
MethodsLung fibrosis was induced by bleomycin in wild-type or Il33r (St2)-/- C57BL/6 mice treated with the recombinant mature form of IL-33 or anti-IL-33 antibody or transferred with type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). The development and severity of fibrosis was evaluated based on lung histology, collagen levels, and lavage cytology. Cytokine and chemokine levels were quantified by using quantitative PCR, ELISA, and cytometry.
Results IL-33 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells but is induced in macrophages by bleomycin. Bleomycin enhanced the production of the mature but reduced full-length form of IL-33 in lung tissue. ST2 deficiency, anti-IL-33 antibody treatment, or alveolar macrophage depletion attenuated and exogenous IL-33 or adoptive transfer of ILC2s enhanced bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. These pathologic changes were accompanied, respectively, by reduced or increased IL-33, IL-13, TGF-$\beta$1, and inflammatory chemokine production in the lung. Furthermore, IL-33 polarized M2 macrophages to produce IL-13 and TGF-$\beta$1 and induced the expansion of ILC2s to produce IL-13 in vitro and in vivo.
Conclusions IL-33 is a novel profibrogenic cytokine that signals through ST2 to promote the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis by recruiting and directing inflammatory cell function and enhancing profibrogenic cytokine production in an ST2- and macrophage-dependent manner.},

Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses.},

Specifically, we examined the MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation and cytokine signaling. Our investigations revealed that immunocompetent TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were not more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis as compared with wild-type mice and that the in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK and p38 was not affected in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 knockout mice following stimulation with conidia. In vivo experiments suggest that ERK was an essential MAPK in the defense against A. fumigatus, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB appeared to play only a secondary role. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLR2/4 recognition and MyD88 signaling are dispensable for the clearance of A. fumigatus under immunocompetent situations. Furthermore, our data stress the important role of ERK activation in innate immunity to A. fumigatus.},

abstract = {Introduction: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has prognostic value in various pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We determined the individual prognostic accuracy of distance walked and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT in patients with IPF. We defined a new composite index, the distance-saturation product (DSP), which is the product of distance walked and lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk test. We compared the performance of the DSP to the individual 6MWT parameters in predicting mortality. Methods: We evaluated pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk parameters and the DSP between survivors and non-survivors. The ability of each measure to discriminate outcomes was determined by receiver operator curves. Results: 81 patients (48 survivors, 33 non-survivors) were included. Pulmonary function tests were similar and did not correlate with survival. Desaturation was greater (89.4{\%} versus 83.7{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and distance walked was lower (406.9 versus 181.3 m, P = 0.005) in non-survivors. The DSP was significantly lower among non-survivors (364.8 versus 153.5 m{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and predicted mortality more accurately than either individual 6MWT component (P = 0.035 versus desaturation, P = 0.040 versus distance). A DSP {\textless}200 m{\%} was associated with a seven-fold greater risk of 12-month mortality and an 18.0{\%} shorter median survival compared with a DSP{\textgreater}200 m{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). Discussion: Each component of the 6-min walk independently predicted mortality in IPF with greater accuracy than spirometry. However, a composite of both parameters, the DSP, provides slightly greater accuracy and represents a novel measure for assessing survival in patients with IPF.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a key component of high-density lipoproteins that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from cells and reduces vascular inflammation. We investigated whether endogenous apoA-I modulates ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation in mice. We found that apoA-I expression was significantly reduced in the lungs of OVA-challenged, compared with saline-challenged, wild-type (WT) mice. Next, to investigate the role of endogenous apoA-I in the pathogenesis of OVA-induced airway inflammation, WT and apoA-I(-/-) mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of OVA and aluminum hydroxide, followed by multiple nasal OVA challenges for 4 weeks. OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice exhibited a phenotype of increased airway neutrophils compared with WT mice, which could be rescued by an administration of a 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Multiple pathways promoted neutrophilic inflammation in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, including the up-regulated expression of (1) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A and TNF-$\alpha$), (2) CXC chemokines (CXCL5), (3) vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and (4) granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). Because concentrations of G-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly increased in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, we hypothesized that enhanced G-CSF expression may represent the predominant pathway mediating increased neutrophilic inflammation. This was confirmed by the intranasal administration of a neutralizing anti-G-CSF antibody, which significantly reduced BALF neutrophilia by 72{\%} in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, compared with mice that received a control antibody. We conclude that endogenous apoA-I negatively regulates OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, primarily via a G-CSF-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, these findings suggest that apoA-I may play an important role in modulating the severity of neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.},

abstract = {Motivation: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in
genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined
by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways.
There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are
typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which
do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of
transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple
molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing.
Results: We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on
functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based
on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects
of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net
regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is
performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on
weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both
simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on
human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly
better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more
pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than
the competing approaches.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for severe, invasive infections in neutropenic hosts. Lung clearance of A. fumigatus conidia seems to be mediated by phagocytic cells and oxygen radicals. It is not known if cytokines or nitrogen radicals are also involved. We tested for the production of TNF alpha, IL-1 and nitric oxide (NO) after stimulation of mouse macrophages with the fungus. We found that both cytokines, but not NO, were produced in a dose-dependent manner during the first 24 h of culture. Except for a faster kinetic, no appreciable differences were seen between alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, both hyphae and conidia, either alive or killed, were capable of inducing cytokines production. However, among different Aspergillus spp. only A. fumigatus and A. flavus seemed to induce significant amount of TNF alpha and IL-1, whereas A. terreus and A. niger were less effective. In no case could we detect production of NO. Finally, macrophages from dexamethasone-treated mice failed to produce cytokines in response to A. fumigatus conidia. These results indicate that in normal hosts inflammatory cytokines contribute to the natural response against Aspergillus infections and suggest that the impairment of cytokine production, in immunodepressed patients, may favour the growth and spread of the fungus},

Using murine models we demonstrate a role for interleukin (IL)-25 in the generation of pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, we identify IL-13 release from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) as sufficient to drive collagen deposition in the lungs of challenged mice and suggest this as a potential mechanism through which IL-25 is acting. Additionally, we demonstrate that in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis there is increased pulmonary expression of IL-25 and also observe a population ILC2 in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Collectively, we present an innate mechanism for the generation of pulmonary fibrosis, via IL-25 and ILC2, that occurs independently of T-cell-mediated antigen-specific immune responses.

abstract = {In addition to the directly mutagenic effects of energy deposition in DNA, ionizing radiation is associated with a variety of untargeted and delayed effects that result in ongoing bone marrow damage. Delayed effects are genotype dependent with CBA/Ca mice, but not C57BL/6 mice, susceptible to the induction of damage and also radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrophages are a potential source of ongoing damaging signals, we have determined their gene expression profiles and we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages show widely different intrinsic expression patterns. The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure.},

abstract = {Background The mechanism of TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2/TH17-low asthma is unknown. Objective We sought to study the immune mechanism of TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2/TH17-low asthma. Methods In a previously reported cohort of 60 asthmatic patients, 16 patients were immunophenotyped with TH2/TH17-predominant asthma and 22 patients with TH2/TH17-low asthma. We examined bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid leukocytes, cytokines, mediators, and epithelial cell function for these asthma subgroups. Results Patients with TH2/TH17-predominant asthma had increased IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-23, C3a, and serum amyloid A levels in BAL fluid, and these correlated with IL-1$\beta$ and C3a levels. TH2/TH17 cells expressed higher levels of the IL-1 receptor and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, inhibited BAL TH2/TH17 cell counts. TH2/TH17-low asthma had 2 distinct subgroups: neutrophilic asthma (45{\%}) and pauci-inflammatory asthma (55{\%}). This contrasted with patients with TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2-predominant asthma, which included neutrophilic asthma in 6{\%} and 0{\%} of patients, respectively. BAL fluid neutrophils strongly correlated with BAL fluid myeloperoxidase, IL-8, IL-1$\alpha$, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. Sixty percent of the patients with neutrophilic asthma had a pathogenic microorganism in BAL culture, which suggested a subclinical infection. Conclusion We uncovered a critical role for the IL-1$\beta$ pathway in patients with TH2/TH17-predminant asthma. A subgroup of patients with TH2/TH17-low asthma had neutrophilic asthma and increased BAL fluid IL-1$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. IL-1$\alpha$ was directly involved in IL-8 production and likely contributed to neutrophilic asthma. Sixty percent of neutrophilic patients had a subclinical infection.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is a common cause of invasive and allergic pulmonary disease. Resting conidia of the filamentous fungus are constantly inhaled, but cause infection only after initiating hyphal growth. In this study, we have explored whether macrophages can distinguish between resting spores and the maturing, potentially invasive form of the fungus. Although macrophages bind and ingest A. fumigatus resting conidia efficiently, there is little inflammatory response; NF-kappabeta is not activated, inflammatory cytokines are not induced, and reactive oxygen species are not produced. However, maturing A. fumigatus conidia and germ tubes stimulate NF-kappabeta, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and production of reactive oxygen by human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophages from multiple anatomical sites. These responses are in part mediated by dectin-1, which binds cell wall beta-glucan that is not present on the surface of dormant conidia, but is present after cellular swelling and loss of the hydrophobic proteinaceous cell wall. Dectin-1 binding to germ tubes augments, but is not required for, TLR2-mediated inflammatory cytokine secretion. Dectin-1 recognition of germ tubes also stimulates TNF-alpha production in the absence of both TLR2 and MyD88 signaling. These data demonstrate one mechanism by which the pulmonary inflammatory response is tailored toward metabolically active cells, thereby avoiding unnecessary tissue damage with frequent inhalation of ubiquitous spores.},

abstract = {Although macrophages are widely recognized to have a profibrotic role in inflammation, we have used a highly tractable CCl(4)-induced model of reversible hepatic fibrosis to identify and characterize the macrophage phenotype responsible for tissue remodeling: the hitherto elusive restorative macrophage. This CD11B(hi) F4/80(int) Ly-6C(lo) macrophage subset was most abundant in livers during maximal fibrosis resolution and represented the principle matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -expressing subset. Depletion of this population in CD11B promoter-diphtheria toxin receptor (CD11B-DTR) transgenic mice caused a failure of scar remodeling. Adoptive transfer and in situ labeling experiments showed that these restorative macrophages derive from recruited Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, a common origin with profibrotic Ly-6C(hi) macrophages, indicative of a phenotypic switch in vivo conferring proresolution properties. Microarray profiling of the Ly-6C(lo) subset, compared with Ly-6C(hi) macrophages, showed a phenotype outside the M1/M2 classification, with increased expression of MMPs, growth factors, and phagocytosis-related genes, including Mmp9, Mmp12, insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), and Glycoprotein (transmembrane) nmb (Gpnmb). Confocal microscopy confirmed the postphagocytic nature of restorative macrophages. Furthermore, the restorative macrophage phenotype was recapitulated in vitro by the phagocytosis of cellular debris with associated activation of the ERK signaling cascade. Critically, induced phagocytic behavior in vivo, through administration of liposomes, increased restorative macrophage number and accelerated fibrosis resolution, offering a therapeutic strategy to this orphan pathological process.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Invasive aspergillosis is a worldwide disease that primarily affects immune-compromised patients, agricultural workers with corneal abrasions, individuals with structural lung disease, and patients with primary immune deficiency. The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets. The strength and efficacy of the host response is shaped by the tissue microenvironment. In preclinical models of disease, host immune augmentation strategies have yielded benefits, yet translating these insights into therapeutic strategies in humans remains challenging. SUMMARY Although advances in early diagnostic strategies and in antifungal drugs have ameliorated clinical outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, further improvements depend on gaining deeper insight into and translating advances in anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

abstract = {Problems related to the safety and efficacy of gene therapies have checked the enthusiasm once surrounding this field, though it remains a promising approach for the treatment of numerous diseases. Despite the high transfection efficiencies attainable using viral vectors, manufacturing difficulties, safety concerns, and limitations related to targeting and plasmid size have prompted considerable research into the development of non-viral vectors. Non-viral vectors demonstrate low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and ease of manufacture. However, they have not yet achieved the transfection efficiencies displayed by viruses. The inability to explain or predict transfection efficiencies results, in part, from insufficient understanding of the intracellular processes involved in gene delivery. Increasingly, research has been undertaken to probe the processes involved in overcoming the major obstacles to vector-mediated transfection: (1) internalization, (2) intracellular trafficking, (3) escape to the cytosol, (4) nuclear translocation, and (5) gene transcription/expression. This paper reviews and compares the pathways and techniques involved in successful viral and non-viral transfection. In addition, this review provides evidence that non-viral vector development has been pursued successfully thus far, producing systems capable of evading almost all major obstacles to transfection. Evaluating the abilities of non-viral and viral vectors to overcome specific cellular barriers reveals that the greatest advantage of viral vectors may be related to viral DNA, which is transcribed considerably more efficiently than plasmid DNA. Further study in this area should enable the development of non-viral vectors that transfect as efficiently as viral vectors.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 the American Physiological Society.Nitrogen mustard (NM) is a vesicant that causes lung injury and fibrosis, accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we analyzed the spleen as a source of these cells. Splenectomized (SPX) and sham control rats were treated intratracheally with NM (0.125 mg/kg) or PBS control. Macrophage responses were analyzed 1–7 days later. Splenectomy resulted in an increase in lung macrophages expressing CCR2, but a decrease in ATR-1a+ cells, receptors important in bone marrow and spleen monocyte trafficking, respectively. Splenectomy was also associated with an increase in proinflammatory M1 (iNOS+, CD11b+CD43+) macrophages in lungs of NM-treated rats, as well as greater upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression. Conversely, a decrease in CD11b+CD43+ M2 macrophages was observed in SPX rats, with no changes in CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, or YM-1+ M2 macrophages, suggesting distinct origins of M2 subpopulations responding to NM. Macrophage expression of M2 genes including IL-10, ApoE, PTX-2, PTX-3, 5-HT2a, and 5-HT7 was also reduced in NM-treated SPX rats compared with shams, indicating impaired M2 activity. Changes in lung macrophages responding to NM as a consequence of splenectomy were correlated with exacerbated tissue injury and more rapid fibrogenesis. These data demonstrate that the spleen is a source of a subset of M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory activity; moreover, in their absence, proinflammatory/ cytotoxic M1 macrophages predominate in the lung, resulting in heightened pathology. Understanding the origin of macrophages and characterizing their phenotype after vesicant exposure may lead to more targeted therapeutics aimed at reducing toxicity and disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {IL-1 is an important mediator of inflammation and tissue damage in multiple organs, both in experimental animal models of disease and in human diseases. The IL-1 family consists of two agonists, IL-1$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$, two receptors, biologically active IL-1RI and inert IL-1RII, and a specific receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. The balance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra in local tissues plays an important role in the susceptibility to and severity of many diseases. An allelic polymorphism in the IL-1Ra gene has been associated with a variety of human diseases primarily of epithelial and endothelial cell origin. This association may be secondary to an imbalance in the IL-1 system with enhanced production of IL-1$\beta$ and reduced production of the major intracellular isoform of IL-1Ra. Treatment of RA with daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant IL-1Ra protein has been shown to be efficacious. Gene therapy approaches with IL-1Ra are being evaluated for the treatment of RA and other human diseases. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the present study, therefore, we examined the additional clinical value of a Treponema pallidum real-time TaqMan PCR for the detection of primary and secondary syphilis. The additional value of the T. pallidum real-time PCR for the diagnosis of primary syphilis was evaluated by the use of three different algorithms: (i) a head-to-head comparison of the dark-field microscopy result and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result, (ii) comparison of the clinical diagnosis made in a sexually transmitted infection clinic (STI) (including by dark-field microscopy) and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result, and (iii) comparison of the clinical diagnosis made in a general practitioner's office (without dark-field microscopy) and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result. A fourth algorithm was used to determine the performance of the T. pallidum real-time PCR regarding the detection of secondary syphilis. From December 2006 to April 2008, 716 patients with suspected cases of primary syphilis and 133 patients with suspected cases of secondary syphilis were included in the study. A kappa value of 0.601 was found for the agreement between dark-field microscopy and the T. pallidum real-time PCR. Good agreement was found between the T. pallidum real-time PCR and both the diagnosis of the general practitioner (kappa = 0.745) and the diagnosis of the STI clinic (kappa = 0.769). The sensitivity with respect to the STI clinic diagnosis was 72.8{\%}, the specificity was 95.5{\%}, the positive predictive value was 89.2{\%}, and the negative predictive value was 95.0{\%}. The T. pallidum real-time PCR is a fast, efficient, and reliable test for the diagnosis of primary syphilis in an STI outpatient clinic and a general practitioner setting, but it has no added diagnostic value for the diagnosis of secondary syphilis.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of identifying differentially expressed groups of genes from a microarray experiment. The groups of genes are ex-ternally defined, for example, sets of gene pathways derived from biological databases. Our starting point is the interesting Gene Set Enrichment Analy-sis (GSEA) procedure of Subramanian et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 15545–15550]. We study the problem in some generality and propose two potential improvements to GSEA: the maxmean statistic for summarizing gene-sets, and restandardization for more accurate inferences. We discuss a variety of examples and extensions, including the use of gene-set scores for class predictions. We also describe a new R language package GSA that im-plements our ideas. 1. Introduction. We discuss the problem of identifying differentially ex-pressed groups of genes from a set of microarray experiments. In the usual situation we have N genes measured on n microarrays, under two different ex-perimental conditions, such as control and treatment. The number of genes N is usually large, say, at least a few thousand, while the number samples n is smaller, say, a hundred or fewer. This problem is an example of multiple hypothesis testing with a large number of tests, one that often arises in genomic and proteomic ap-plications, and also in signal processing. We focus mostly on the gene expression problem, but our proposed methods are more widely applicable. Most approaches start by computing a two-sample t-statistic z j for each gene. Genes having t-statistics larger than a pre-defined cutoff (in absolute value) are declared significant, and then the family-wise error rate or false discovery rate of the resulting gene list is assessed by comparing the tail area from a null distribution of the statistic. This null distribution is derived from data permutations, or from asymptotic theory. In an interesting and useful paper, Subramanian et al. (2005) proposed a method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for assessing the significance of pre-defined gene-sets, rather than individual genes. The gene-sets can be derived from different sources, for example, the sets of genes representing biological pathways},

Exosomes, membrane vesicles released from cells within the lung allograft, contain a diverse array of biomolecules that closely reflect the biologic state of the cell and tissue from which they are released. Exosome transcriptomes may provide a better understanding of the rejection process. Furthermore, biomarkers originating from this transcriptome could provide timely and sensitive detection of acute cellular rejection (AR), reducing the incidence of severe AR and chronic lung allograft dysfunction and improving outcomes. OBJECTIVES To provide an in-depth analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid exosomal shuttle RNA population after lung transplantation and evaluate for differential expression between acute AR and quiescence. METHODS Serial bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were ultracentrifuged to obtain the exosomal pellet for RNA extraction, on which RNA-Seq was performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS AR demonstrates an intense inflammatory environment, skewed toward both innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel, potential upstream regulators identified offer potential therapeutic targets. CONCLUSIONS Our findings validate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid exosomal shuttle RNA as a source for understanding the pathophysiology of AR and for biomarker discovery in lung transplantation.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial pneumonia. The disease pathophysiology is poorly understood and the etiology remains unclear. Recent advances have generated new therapies and improved knowledge of the natural history of IPF. These gains have been brokered by advances in technology and improved insight into the role of various genes in mediating disease, but gene expression and protein levels do not always correlate. Thus, in this paper we apply a novel large scale high throughput aptamer approach to identify more than 1100 proteins in the peripheral blood of well-characterized IPF patients and normal volunteers. We use systems biology approaches to identify a unique IPF proteome signature and give insight into biological processes driving IPF. We found IPF plasma to be altered and enriched for proteins involved in defense response, wound healing and protein phosphorylation when compared to normal human plasma. Analysis also revealed a minimal protein signature that differentiated IPF patients from normal controls, which may allow for accurate diagnosis of IPF based on easily-accessible peripheral blood. This report introduces large scale unbiased protein discovery analysis to IPF and describes distinct biological processes that further inform disease biology.},

The primary goals of this Review series on fibrotic diseases are to discuss some of the major fibroproliferative diseases and to identify the common and unique mechanisms of fibrogenesis that might be exploited in the development of effective antifibrotic therapies.},

abstract = {Gene set analysis methods, which consider predefined groups of genes in the analysis of genomic data, have been successfully applied for analyzing gene expression data in cross-sectional studies. The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) introduced here is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates. It allows to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When biological conditions are compared, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. The interest of the method is illustrated by its application to two real life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial), and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis corrected for multiple testing as well as a standard a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series both failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. When applied to the second illustrative data set, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets finally found to be linked with the influenza vaccine too although they were found to be associated to the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses. In our simulation study TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is made available for the community through an R package.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless} 0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can emerge from certain pathologies, such as sepsis, fat embolism and leptospirosis, in which the levels of unesterified fatty acids are increased in the patient's plasma. ARDS is characterized by edema formation, and edema resolution occurs mainly due to the pneumocyte Na/K-ATPase activity. As previously described, increased oleic acid (OA) plasma concentrations induce lung injury by interfering with sodium transport. The first aim of this study was to develop a radioactivity-free assay to detect Na,K-ATPase activity ex vivo using a model of OA-induced lung injury in mice. We also investigated the relationship between Na/K-ATPase inhibition and OA-induced lung injury using ouabain-induced lung injury as a comparison, because of the well-described effect of ouabain as a Na/K-ATPase inhibitor.METHODS:We developed a Na/K-ATPase assay based on the capture of non-radioactive Rb+ ions by mice lung tissue in the absence or presence of ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase inhibitor. Rb+ incorporation into the lung was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after lung tissue mineralization. Na/K-ATPase activity was considered as the difference between Rb+ incorporation in the absence and in the presence of ouabain. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected for lung injury assessment. For this assessment, cell counting, lipid body enumeration and lipid mediator concentrations were measured. Histological analyses were used to determinate lung pathology. Whole body plethysmographic analysis was performed to assay lung function.RESULTS:The lung Na/K-ATPase activity of mice was completely inhibited by an OA dose of 10mumol, an effect also obtained with 10-3mumol of ouabain, as demonstrated by the decreased Rb+ incorporation in the lungs. The same OA dose induced lung edema and inflammation with cell influx, lipid body formation, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Ouabain also induced lung inflammation, as detected by histological examinations. As far as we know, this is the first time that ouabain-induced lung injury was shown. Both OA and ouabain induced functional lung pathology in mice simultaneously with inhibition of the lung Na/K-ATPase activity.CONCLUSIONS:We developed a new non-radioactive assay to quantified Na/K-ATPase in vivo. OA and ouabain inhibited in vivo Na/K-ATPase activity in the lungs and induced lung injury. Our data reinforce the idea that Na/K-ATPase inhibitors may worsen lung injury in specific pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Background TH2 cells can further differentiate into dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells. The presence of dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in the airways and their effect on asthma severity are unknown. Objective We sought to study dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from asthmatic patients, examine their response to glucocorticoids, and define their relevance for disease severity. Methods Bronchoscopy and lavage were performed in 52 asthmatic patients and 25 disease control subjects. TH2 and TH2/TH17 cells were analyzed by using multicolor flow cytometry and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytokines were assayed by means of ELISA. Results Dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells were present at a higher frequency in BAL fluid from asthmatic patients compared with numbers seen in disease control subjects. High-level IL-4 production was typically accompanied by high-level IL-17 production and coexpression of GATA3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor $\gamma$t. Increased presence of TH2/TH17 cells was associated with increased IL-17 production in lavage fluid. TH2/TH17 cell counts and IL-17 production correlated with PC20 for methacholine, eosinophil counts, and FEV1. TH2/TH17 cells, unlike TH2 cells, were resistant to dexamethasone-induced cell death. They expressed higher levels of mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1, a molecule that induces glucocorticoid resistance. On the basis of the dominance of BAL fluid TH2 or TH2/TH17 cells, we identified 3 subgroups of asthma: TH2predominant, TH2/TH17predominant, and TH2/TH17low. The TH2/TH17predominant subgroup manifested the most severe form of asthma, whereas the TH2/TH17low subgroup had the mildest asthma. Conclusion Asthma is associated with a higher frequency of dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in BAL fluid. The TH2/TH17predominant subgroup of asthmatic patients manifested glucocorticoid resistance in vitro. They also had the greatest airway obstruction and hyperreactivity compared with the TH2predominant and TH2/TH17low subgroups.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review examines the recent literature on molecular biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specific attention is dedicated to the recent studies that identified the genes associated with IPF and the peripheral blood biomarkers that predict outcome in IPF. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple studies attempted to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in IPF. Until recently, these studies were limited in size and lacked replication, but still when taken together provided convincing evidence that changes in blood proteins (KL-6, SP-A, MMP-7, CCL-18, among others) or cells (fibrocytes and T-cell subpopulations) are indicative of the disease presence and outcome. More recently, larger studies have identified gene polymorphisms associated with IPF, as well as protein markers and integrated clinical and molecular prediction rules that accurately predict outcome in patients with IPF. SUMMARY The peripheral blood contains disease presence and outcome relevant information, and suggests distinct biologically defined outcome trajectories in patients with IPF. Although recently identified biomarkers should still be validated in multiple clinical contexts, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that collection of peripheral blood biomarkers needs to be incorporated in the design of drug studies and that some of these markers be clinically evaluated in lung transplant prioritization.},

abstract = {A novel, MS-based approach for the relative quantification of proteins, relying on the derivatization of primary amino groups in intact proteins using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is presented. Due to the isobaric mass design of the iTRAQ reagents, differentially labeled proteins do not differ in mass; accordingly, their corresponding proteolytic peptides appear as single peaks in MS scans. Because quantitative information is provided by isotope-encoded reporter ions that can only be observed in MS/MS spectra, we analyzed the fragmentation behavior of ESI and MALDI ions of peptides generated from iTRAQ-labeled proteins using a TOF/TOF and/or a QTOF instrument. We observed efficient liberation of reporter ions for singly protonated peptides at low-energy collision conditions. In contrast, increased collision energies were required to liberate the iTRAQ label from lysine side chains of doubly charged peptides and, thus, to observe reporter ions suitable for relative quantification of proteins with high accuracy. We then developed a quantitative strategy that comprises labeling of intact proteins by iTRAQ followed by gel electrophoresis and peptide MS/MS analyses. As proof of principle, mixtures of five different proteins in various concentration ratios were quantified, demonstrating the general applicability of the approach presented here to quantitative MS-based proteomics.},

abstract = {Human monocytes are commonly defined and discriminated by the extent of their cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, with associated differences in function and phenotype related to the intensity of expression of these markers. With increasing interest into the function and behaviour of monocytes, it is important to have a clear understanding of how differing strategies of analysis can affect results and how different protocols and population backgrounds can affect this highly morphogenic cell type.Using PBMCs from populations with differing ethnicities and histories of parasite exposure we have characterized monocyte phenotype based on intensity of CD14 and CD16 expression. Using the surface markers HLA-DR, CCR2 and CX3CR1, we compared monocyte phenotype between populations and further assessed changes in monocytes with freezing and thawing of PBMCs.Our results reveal that there is a progression of surface marker expression based on intensity of CD14 or CD16 expression, stressing the importance of careful gating of monocyte subtypes. Freezing and thawing of the PBMCs has no effect generally on the monocytes, although it does lead to a decrease in CD16 and CX3CR1 expression. We show that there are differences in the monocyte populations based on ethnicity and history of exposure to the common parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.This study highlights that blood monocytes consist of a continuous population of cells, within which the dominant phenotype may vary dependent on the background of the study population. Comparing results from monocyte studies therefore needs to be done with great care, as ethnic background of donor population, gating strategy and processing of PBMCs may all have an effect on outcome of monocyte phenotype. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abundant collagen production and accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) in the lower respiratory tract. Mechanisms as to how alveolar macrophages are activated by collagen breakdown products are unknown. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 37 healthy donors (HD). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in the presence of collagen type I, III, IV and V monomers w/wo a neutralizing antibody against scavenger receptor I class A (CD204). Culture supernatants were assayed for the M2 markers CCL18, CCL2, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) by ELISA. Furthermore, expression of phospho-Akt was measured using ELISA and expression of CD204 by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stimulation with collagen type I and III monomers significantly up-regulated CCL18, IL-1ra production of alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CD204 were up-regulated by collagen type I exposure. In addition, collagen type I stimulation increased pospho-Akt expression. Collagen type I effects were abrogated by neutralizing antiCD204 and a non-selective Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Spontaneous CD204 expression of alveolar macrophages was significantly increased in patients with IPF. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that monomeric collagen type I via CD204 induces phospho-Akt expression shifting alveolar macrophages to the profibrotic M2 type. Innate immune responses induced by collagen monomers might perpetuate pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive inflammatory disease with limited therapeutic options. To better understand the inflammatory responses that precede and concur with collagen deposition, we used three models of pulmonary fibrosis and identify a critical mechanistic role for IL-17A. After exposure to bleomycin (BLM), but not Schistosoma mansoni eggs, IL-17A produced by CD4(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells induced significant neutrophilia and pulmonary fibrosis. Studies conducted with C57BL/6 il17a(-/-) mice confirmed an essential role for IL-17A. Mechanistically, using ifngamma(-/-), il10(-/-), il10(-/-)il12p40(-/-), and il10(-/-)il17a(-/-) mice and TGF-beta blockade, we demonstrate that IL-17A-driven fibrosis is suppressed by IL-10 and facilitated by IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40. BLM-induced IL-17A production was also TGF-beta dependent, and recombinant IL-17A-mediated fibrosis required TGF-beta, suggesting cooperative roles for IL-17A and TGF-beta in the development of fibrosis. Finally, we show that fibrosis induced by IL-1beta, which mimics BLM-induced fibrosis, is also highly dependent on IL-17A. IL-17A and IL-1beta were also increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with IPF. Together, these studies identify a critical role for IL-17A in fibrosis, illustrating the potential utility of targeting IL-17A in the treatment of drug and inflammation-induced fibrosis.},

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade all of the extracellular matrix components of the intersititium and may play a role in abnormal alveolar permeability, which is a feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The aims of the present study were to evaluate MMP protein levels in patients with IPF and determine any relationship to treatment and markers of permeability. In total, 20 patients with IPF and eight normal controls underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. MMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were related to clinical outcome and protein permeability index. MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9 were elevated in IPF lavage fluid and levels remained high despite treatment. Levels of MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9, VEGF and protein permeability index were higher in those who died early during follow-up. VEGF, and MMP-8 and -9 levels were higher in those with a rapidly declining lung function over 1 yr. Levels of MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9 correlated with an increased permeability index. Matrix metalloproteinase levels were elevated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and were not modulated by current standard treatment. Matrix metalloproteinase production through an interaction with the known vascular permogen, vascular endothelial growth factor, was potentially associated with abnormal capillary permeability and may have potentiated the neo-angiogenesis seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The changes were greatest in those who died or progressed during follow-up, suggesting that drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor or matrix metalloproteinase activity warrant assessment as novel therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {During inflammation, leukocytes influx into lung compartments and interact with extracellular matrix (ECM). Two ECM components, versican and hyaluronan, increase in a range of lung diseases. The interaction of leukocytes with these ECM components controls leukocyte retention and accumulation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and activation as part of the inflammatory phase of lung disease. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic children co-cultured with human lung fibroblasts generate an ECM that is adherent for monocytes/macrophages. Macrophages are present in both early and late lung inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10) is induced in alveolar macrophages with injury and infection and modulates macrophage phenotype and their ability to degrade collagenous ECM components. Collectively, studies outlined in this review highlight the importance of specific ECM components in the regulation of inflammatory events in lung disease. The widespread involvement of these ECM components in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation make them attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {The past several years have seen the accumulation of evidence demonstrating that tissue injury induced by diverse toxicants is due not only to their direct effects on target tissues but also indirectly to the actions of resident and infiltrating macrophages. These cells release an array of mediators with cytotoxic, pro- and anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, fibrogenic, and mitogenic activity, which function to fight infections, limit tissue injury, and promote wound healing. However, following exposure to toxicants, macrophages can become hyperresponsive, resulting in uncontrolled or dysregulated release of mediators that exacerbate acute tissue injury and/or promote the development of chronic diseases such as fibrosis and cancer. Evidence suggests that the diverse activity of macrophages is mediated by distinct subpopulations that develop in response to signals within their microenvironment. Understanding the precise roles of these different macrophage populations in the pathogenic response to toxicants is key to designing effective treatments for minimizing tissue damage and chronic disease and for facilitating wound repair.},

abstract = {Macrophages are either classically (M1) or alternatively-activated (M2). Whereas this nomenclature was generated from monocyte-derived macrophages treated in vitro with defined cytokine stimuli, the phenotype of in vivo-derived macrophages is less understood. We completed Affymetrix-based transcriptomic analysis of macrophages from the resolution phase of a zymosan-induced peritonitis. Compared with macrophages from hyperinflamed mice possessing a pro-inflammatory nature as well as naive macrophages from the uninflamed peritoneum, resolution-phase macrophages (rM) are similar to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), being CD209a positive but lacking CD11c. They are enriched for antigen processing/presentation (MHC class II [H2-Eb1, H2-Ab1, H2-Ob, H2-Aa], CD74, CD86), secrete T- and B-lymphocyte chemokines (Xcl1, Ccl5, Cxcl13) as well as factors that enhance macrophage/DC development, and promote DC/T cell synapse formation (Clec2i, Tnfsf4, Clcf1). rM are also enriched for cell cycle/proliferation genes as well as Alox15, Timd4, and Tgfb2, key systems in the termination of leukocyte trafficking and clearance of inflammatory cells. Finally, comparison with in vitro-derived M1/M2 shows that rM are neither classically nor alternatively activated but possess aspects of both definitions consistent with an immune regulatory phenotype. We propose that macrophages in situ cannot be rigidly categorized as they can express many shades of the inflammatory spectrum determined by tissue, stimulus, and phase of inflammation.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

Carbon tetrachloride---induced liver fibrosis revealed scar-associated macrophages that persisted throughout recovery. A transgenic mouse (CD11b-DTR) was generated in which macrophages could be selectively depleted. Macrophage depletion when liver fibrosis was advanced resulted in reduced scarring and fewer myofibroblasts. Macrophage depletion during recovery, by contrast, led to a failure of matrix degradation. These data provide the first clear evidence that functionally distinct subpopulations of macrophages exist in the same tissue and that these macrophages play critical roles in both the injury and recovery phases of inflammatory scarring.},

Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 3.77 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 and 94.3{\%} accuracy. Cut-off values of 4.66 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 2.52 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 possessed 99.4 and 93.2{\%} accuracy for differentiating among the IPF and other interstitial lung disease groups. Conclusions: Innate immune responses may be associated with the development of IPF. Furthermore, the IL-33 and TSLP levels in BAL fluids may be useful for differentiating IPF from other chronic interstitial lung diseases.},

abstract = {Macrophage activation is associated with profound transcriptional reprogramming. Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processesremain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages. This resource serves as a framework for future research into regulation of macrophage activation in health and disease. copy; 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Macrophages are unique cells for origin, heterogeneity and plasticity. At steady state most of macrophages are derived from fetal sources and maintained in adulthood through self-renewing. Despite sharing common progenitors, a remarkable heterogeneity characterized tissue-resident macrophages indicating that local signals educate them to express organ-specific functions. Macrophages are extremely plastic: chromatin landscape and transcriptional programs can be dynamically re-shaped in response to microenvironmental changes. Owing to their ductility, macrophages are crucial orchestrators of both initiation and resolution of immune responses and key supporters of tissue development and functions in homeostatic and pathological conditions. Herein, we describe current understanding of heterogeneity and plasticity of macrophages using the M1-M2 dichotomy as operationally useful simplification of polarized activation. We focused on the complex network of signaling cascades, metabolic pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic changes that control macrophage activation. In particular, this network was addressed in sepsis, as a paradigm of a pathological condition determining dynamic macrophage reprogramming.},

abstract = {Airway colonization by the mold Aspergillus fumigatus is common in patients with underlying lung disease and is associated with chronic airway inflammation. Studies probing the inflammatory response to colonization with A. fumigatus hyphae have been hampered by the lack of a model of chronic colonization in immunocompetent mice. By infecting mice intratracheally with conidia embedded in agar beads (Af beads), we have established an in vivo model to study the natural history of airway colonization with live A. fumigatus hyphae. Histopathological examination and galactomannan assay of lung homogenates demonstrated that hyphae exited beads and persisted in the lungs of mice up to 28 days postinfection without invasive disease. Fungal lesions within the airways were surrounded by a robust neutrophilic inflammatory reaction and peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes. Whole-lung cytokine analysis from Af bead-infected mice revealed an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines early in infection. Evidence of a Th2 type response was observed only early in the course of colonization, including increased levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), elevated IgE levels in serum, and a mild increase in airway responsiveness. Pulmonary T cell subset analysis during infection mirrored these results with an initial transient increase in IL-4-producing CD4(+) T cells, followed by a rise in IL-17 and Foxp3(+) cells by day 14. These results provide the first report of the evolution of the immune response to A. fumigatus hyphal colonization.},

Intravascular functions of " classical " Ly6C + monocytes and their interactions with other lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes in the circulation remain poorly understood. Rather, these cells are known to efficiently extravasate into tissues. Indeed, Ly6C + monocytes and their descendants have emerged as a third, highly plastic and dynamic cellular system that complements the two classical, tissue-resident mononuclear phagocyte compartments, i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells, on demand. Following recruitment to injured tissue, Ly6C + monocytes respond to local cues and can critically contribute to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory reactions. The second main murine monocyte subset, Ly6C – cells, derive in steady state from Ly6C + monocytes and remain in the vasculature, where the cells act as scavengers. Moreover, a major fraction of Ly6C – monocytes adheres to the capillary endothelium and patrols the vessel wall for surveillance. Given the central role of monocytes in homeostasis and pathology, in-depth study of this cellular compartment can be highly informative on the health state of the organism and provides an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

abstract = {AIM Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by immune abnormalities, progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and microvascular injury and damage. Interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is expressed in the epidermis from patients with SSc. However, information describing the role of IL-21 in SSc is limited. METHODS We established a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) IL-21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells in peripheral blood, skin and lungs of BLM-induced mice were detected by flow cytometry; IL-21 levels in the peripheral blood were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD4(+) T cells were isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced and control mice and cultured in vitro alone or in the presence of mrIL-21 or mrIL-21 plus transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$1. The frequency of Th17 cells was detected by flow cytometry; levels of IL-17 were evaluated by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors gamma t (ROR$\gamma$t) messenger RNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Compared to control mice, the frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were significantly increased in BLM-induced mice. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were correlated with dermal and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analyses indicate that IL-21 promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells from CD4(+) cells isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced mice. CONCLUSION IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSc as a Th17 effector cytokine, and IL-21 may induce the differentiation of Th17 cells in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model.},

Therefore, imaging probes that specifically recognize these pools of activated immune cells could provide valuable information about how these cells contribute to the pathobiology of the disease. Here we demonstrate that cysteine cathepsin-targeted imaging probes can be used to monitor the contribution of macrophages to fibrotic disease progression in the bleomycin-induced murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we show that the probes highlight regions of macrophage involvement in fibrosis in human biopsy tissues from IPF patients. Finally, we present first-in-human results demonstrating non-invasive imaging of active cathepsins in fibrotic lesions of patients with IPF. Together, our findings validate small molecule cysteine cathepsin probes for clinical PET imaging and suggest that they have the potential to be used to generate mechanistically-informative molecular information regarding cellular drivers of IPF disease severity and progression.},

Its epidemiology has been difficult to study because of its rarity and evolution in diagnostic and coding practices. Though uncommon, it is likely underappreciated both in terms of its occurrence (ie, incidence, prevalence) and public health impact (ie, health care costs and resource utilization). Incidence and mortality appear to be on the rise, and prevalence is expected to increase with the aging population. Potential risk factors include occupational and environmental exposures, tobacco smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, and genetic factors. An accurate understanding of its epidemiology is important, especially as novel therapies are emerging.},

abstract = {Although acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with inflammation and surfactant dysfunction, the precise sequence of these changes remains poorly described. We used oleic acid to study the pathogenesis of ALI in spontaneously breathing anesthetized rats. We found that lung pathology can occur far more rapidly than previously appreciated. Lung neutrophils were increased approximately threefold within 5 min, and surfactant composition was dramatically altered within 15 min. Alveolar cholesterol increased by approximately 200{\%}, and even though disaturated phospholipids increased by approximately 30{\%} over 4 h, the disaturated phospholipid-to-total phospholipid ratio fell. Although the alveolocapillary barrier was profoundly disrupted after just 15 min, with marked elevations in lung fluid ((99m)Tc-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) and (125)I-labeled albumin flux, the lung rapidly began to regain its sieving properties. Despite the restoration in lung permeability, the animals remained hypoxic even though minute ventilation was increased approximately twofold and static compliance progressively deteriorated. This study highlights that ALI can set in motion a sequence of events continuing the respiratory failure irrespective of the alveolar surfactant pool size and the status of the alveolocapillary barrier.},

abstract = {Background aims: Adult stem cell-based therapy is a promising novel approach for treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of isolated human peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells in an ALI rat model, induced by oleic acid (OA) injection. Methods: Seventy-five adult female rats were used in this study. Group A, control without treatment, and group B, control injected with phosphate-buffered saline, comprised 15 rats each; the remaining 45 rats were injected with OA to induce ALI and were further subdivided into 3 groups: group C (ALI group, 15 rats), group D (ALI and fibroblast group, 15 rats) and group E (ALI and CD34+ cell group, 15 rats). Results: CD34+ cells transplantation in rats with OA-induced lung injury improves the arterial PaO2and wet/dry ratio, reduces infiltration of inflammatory cells and decreases lung vascular permeability as determined by reduced intra-alveolar and interstitial patchy congestion and hemorrhage as well as decreased interstitial edema. Additionally, lung inflammation determined by expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ was attenuated in CD34+ cell-treated rats at 6, 24 and 48 h post-OA challenge compared with non-treated rats. Moreover, the expression of anti-inflammatory molecule interleukin-10 was up-regulated in the lung of OA-induced ALI rats after administration of CD34+ cells. The important finding was that human TNF-$\alpha$-induced protein 6 (TSG-6) gene expression was significantly up-regulated in rats treated with CD34+ cells. Conclusions: The freshly isolated human peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells may be used as an important source of stem cells that improve ALI. The anti-inflammatory properties of CD34+ cells in the lung are explained, at least in part, by activation of CD34+ cells to express TSG-6.},

In this Review, we discuss the unique characteristics of alveolar macrophages, the mechanisms that drive their adaptation and the direct and indirect influences of epithelial cells on them. We also highlight how airway luminal macrophages function as sentinels of a healthy state and how they do not respond in a pro-inflammatory manner to antigens that do not disrupt lung structure. The unique tissue location and function of alveolar macrophages distinguish them from other macrophage populations and suggest that it is important to classify macrophages according to the site that they occupy.},

abstract = {Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by an early inflammatory response followed by a late fibroproliferative phase, and by an increase in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) concentrations of bioactive soluble FasL (sFasL). Activation of Fas (CD95) has been associated with the development of lung fibrosis in mice. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms that link Fas activation with the development of fibrosis in the lungs. We treated mice with three daily intratracheal instillations of a Fas-activating monoclonal antibody (Jo2) or a control IgG, and studied the animals at sequential times. Mice treated with Jo2 had increased caspase-3 activation in alveolar wall cells on Days 2, 4, and 7; an inflammatory response peaking on Day 7, and increased total lung collagen on Day 21. Gene expression profiling performed on Days 2, 4, and 7 showed sequential activation of co-regulated profibrotic genes, including marked up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12). Targeted deletion of MMP-12 protected mice from Fas-induced pulmonary fibrosis, even though the inflammatory responses in the lungs were similar to those of wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, the mmp12(-/-) mice showed decreased expression of the profibrotic genes egr1 and cyr61. We conclude that Fas activation in the lungs induces a complex response that includes apoptosis, inflammation, and eventually fibrosis, and that MMP-12 is essential for the fibrotic phenotype. We speculate that MMP-12 activity is required for activation of the profibrotic genes egr1 and cyr61.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

abstract = {Abstract Bleomycin (BLM) is a drug used to treat different types of neoplasms. BLM's most severe adverse effect is lung toxicity, which induces remodeling of lung architecture and loss of pulmonary function, rapidly leading to death. While its clinical role as an anticancer agent is limited, its use in experimental settings is widespread since BLM is one of the most widely used drugs for inducing lung fibrosis in animals, due to its ability to provoke a histologic lung pattern similar to that described in patients undergoing chemotherapy. This pattern is characterized by patchy parenchymal inflammation, epithelial cell injury with reactive hyperplasia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, activation and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, basement membrane and alveolar epithelium injuries. Several studies have demonstrated that BLM damage is mediated by DNA strand scission producing single- or double-strand breaks that lead to increased production of free radicals. Up to now, the mechanisms involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis have not been fully understood; several studies have analyzed various potential biological molecular factors, such as transforming growth factor beta 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, components of the extracellular matrix, chaperones, interleukins and chemokines. The aim of this paper is to review the specific characteristics of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in different animal models and to summarize modalities and timing of in vivo drug administration. Understanding the mechanisms of BLM-induced lung fibrosis and of commonly used therapies for counteracting fibrosis provides an opportunity for translating potential molecular targets from animal models to the clinical arena.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is synthesized in the liver and in macrophages, and it has antiatherogenic properties that are mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of plasma cholesterol homeostasis. Previous data suggest that apoE also has antiinflammatory properties that may contribute to protection against atherosclerosis independent of its role in lipid metabolism. In this study, apoE knockout and C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We show that apoE modulates the systemic type I inflammatory response in vivo. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and interferon-gamma were upregulated to a significantly greater extent in apoE-deficient mice than in wild-type mice at both the mRNA and protein levels following administration of LPS. In contrast, hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein receptor/apobec-1 double knockout mice had a similar cytokine response as wild-type mice, eliminating hypercholesterolemia as a cause for the exaggerated cytokine response. Importantly, reconstitution of apoE expression in the liver of apoE-deficient mice normalized the LPS-induced plasma protein levels of IL-12p40. Furthermore, there was selective upregulation of plasma IL-12 in apoE knockout mice by a TLR3 agonist, poly I:C, but not by other TLR agonists, CpG oligonucleotide or Toxoplasma gondii antigen. This implies that apoE selectively regulates TLR4- and TLR3-mediated signaling of IL-12 production. These results indicate that apoE modulates the T helper-1-type immune response in vivo by modulating IL-12 production.},

abstract = {Clear identification of specific cell populations by flow cytometry is important to understand functional roles. A well-defined flow cytometry panel for myeloid cells in human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a flow cytometry-based panel for human BAL and lung tissue. We obtained and performed flow cytometry/sorting on human BAL cells and lung tissue. Confocal images were obtained from lung tissue using antibodies for cluster of differentiation (CD)206, CD169, and E cadherin. We defined a multicolor flow panel for human BAL and lung tissue that identifies major leukocyte populations. These include macrophage (CD206(+)) subsets and other CD206(-) leukocytes. The CD206(-) cells include: (1) three monocyte (CD14(+)) subsets, (2) CD11c(+) dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(+), HLA-DR(+)), (3) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(+)), and (4) other granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils). Using this panel on human lung tissue, we defined two populations of pulmonary macrophages: CD169(+) and CD169(-) macrophages. In lung tissue, CD169(-) macrophages were a prominent cell type. Using confocal microscopy, CD169(+) macrophages were located in the alveolar space/airway, defining them as alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CD169(-) macrophages were associated with airway/alveolar epithelium, consistent with interstitial-associated macrophages. We defined a flow cytometry panel in human BAL and lung tissue that allows identification of multiple immune cell types and delineates alveolar from interstitial-associated macrophages. This study has important implications for defining myeloid cells in human lung samples.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oleic acid has been used to induce acute lung injury (ALI) in animals. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the blood level of oleic acid was increased. The mechanism and therapeutic regimen of ARDS and oleic acid-induced ALI remain undefined. In the present study, we investigated the oleic acid-induced changes in lung variables for the measure of ALI, inflammatory mediators, and neutrophil-derived substances. We evaluated the effects of pretreatment and posttreatment with propofol. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g. INTERVENTIONS: We employed a conscious and unrestrained rat model. Oleic acid at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered intravenously. Propofol (30 mg/kg) was given by intravenous infusion (6 mg/kg/min for 5 mins) 30 mins before (pretreatment) and 30 mins after (posttreatment) oleic acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We monitored the arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood gas. The lung weight changes, exhaled nitric oxide, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and Evans blue content in lung tissue were determined. The plasma nitrate/nitrite, methylguanidine, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10), neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase) were detected. Histopathological examination of the lung was performed. Oleic acid caused systemic hypotension and severe ALI as evidenced by the increases in the extent of ALI, impairment of pulmonary functions (blood gas variables), and lung pathology. In addition, oleic acid significantly increased inflammatory mediators and neutrophil-derived factors but depressed Na+-K+-ATPase. The inducible nitric oxide synthase was up-regulated. Pre- or posttreatment with propofol was capable of reversing the oleic acid-induced changes and attenuating the extent of ALI. CONCLUSIONS: Oleic acid resulted in sepsis-like responses including ALI, inflammatory reaction, and increased neutrophil-derived factors. It depressed the Na+-K+-ATPase activity but up-regulated inducible nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with propofol abrogated or reversed the oleic acid-induced changes.},

abstract = {The understanding of how cellular productivity is modulated in cell lines is of significant importance in the biopharmaceutical industry. Often, single molecular mechanisms fail to fully explain how specific antibody productivity is enhanced during proliferation arrest. Previously, we reported that certain physiological changes occur when proliferation is arrested by p21(CIP1) over expression. In this work, we correlate physiological and molecular factors to enhance antibody productivity. Using biomass, cell volume and total cellular protein content as a basis for determining specific productivity, it was found that total cellular protein correlated best with cellular productivity. This meant that there was no preferential increase in antibody production relative to cellular proteins in arrested cultures. However, molecular analysis of mRNA transcription and stability indicated that both processes were altered in arrested cultures resulting in up to threefold increased heavy chain mRNA levels. While flow cytometric analysis revealed that arrested cells had elevated translational capacity for both heavy and light chains, the heavy to light chain polypeptide ratio was 10-50{\%} higher than in the control. This resulted in a lower extracellular accumulation of light chains and a better utilization of cellular resources for the formation of complete antibodies. Active transcriptional regulation of heavy and light chain mRNA and the modulation of translational activities play a vital role in the modulation of overall antibody productivity of these cells. The combined effect of heavy chain mRNA enhancement and the increased cellular assembly capacity was determined to effectively increase specific productivity.},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

abstract = {By regulating the cell number and eliminating harmful cells, programmed cell death plays a critical role in development, homeostasis, and disease. While apoptosis is a recognized form of programmed cell death, necrosis was considered a type of uncontrolled cell death induced by extreme physical or chemical stress. However, recent studies have revealed the existence of a genetically programmed and regulated form of necrosis, termed necroptosis. Necroptosis is defined as necrotic cell death that is dependent on receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). RIPK3, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and a mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) form a multiprotein complex called a necrosome. Although necroptosis generally provides a cell-autonomous host defense, on the other hand, cell rupture caused by necroptosis induces inflammation through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as mitochondrial DNA, HMGB1, and IL-1. Previously, necroptosis was considered an alternative to apoptosis, but it is becoming increasingly clear that necroptosis itself is relevant to clinical disease, independent of apoptosis. According to some recent studies, autophagy, a cellular process for organelle and protein turnover, regulates necroptosis. This review outlines the principal components of necroptosis and provides an overview of the emerging importance of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, infection, and sepsis. We also discuss the molecular relationship between necroptosis and autophagy. Strategies targeting necroptosis may yield novel therapies for pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

Numerous antifibrotic strategies have been used in the clinic with limited success, raising the possibility that an effective therapeutic strategy in this disease must inhibit fibrosis and promote appropriate lung repair mechanisms. IL-13 represents an attractive target in IPF, but its disease association and mechanism of action remains unknown. In the present study, an overexpression of IL-13 and IL-13 pathway markers was associated with IPF, particularly a rapidly progressive form of this disease. Targeting IL-13 in a humanized experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis using tralokinumab (CAT354) was found to therapeutically block aberrant lung remodeling in this model. However, targeting IL-13 was also found to promote lung repair and to restore epithelial integrity. Thus, targeting IL-13 inhibits fibrotic processes and enhances repair processes in the lung.},

In particular, macrophage metalloelastase, also identified as MMP-12, is known to be involved in remodeling processes under pathological conditions. However, MMP-12 involvement in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. Here we investigated fibrotic response to bleomycin in MMP-12 deficient mice.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Background Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen and ??-smooth muscle actin in the lung. The key molecules that promote these phenotypes are of clinical interest. Objectives Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been found at high levels in patients with asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and TSLP has been proposed as a primary driver of lung fibrotic disease. We asked whether tumor necrosis factor superfamily protein 14 (TNFSF14) (aka LIGHT) controls TSLP production to initiate fibrosis. Methods Expression of TSLP and initiation of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin were assessed in mice deficient in LIGHT. The ability of recombinant LIGHT, given intratracheally to naive mice, to promote TSLP and fibrosis was also determined. Results Genetic deletion of LIGHT abolished lung TSLP expression driven by bleomycin, accompanied by near-complete absence of accumulation of lung collagen and ??-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, recombinant LIGHT administered in vivo induced lung expression of TSLP in the absence of other inflammatory stimuli, and strikingly reproduced the primary features of bleomycin-driven disease in a TSLP-dependent manner. Blockade of LIGHT binding to either of its receptors, herpes virus entry mediator and lymphotoxin beta receptor, inhibited clinical symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, and correspondingly both receptors were found on human bronchial epithelial cells, a primary source of TSLP. Moreover, LIGHT induced TSLP directly in human bronchial epithelial cells and synergized with IL-13 and TGF-?? in vivo to promote TSLP in the lungs and drive fibrosis. Conclusions These results show that LIGHT is a profibrogenic cytokine that may be a key driver of TSLP production during the initiation and development of lung fibrotic disease.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has an unpredictable course and prognostic factors are incompletely understood. We aimed to identify prognostic factors, including multidimensional indices from a significant IPF cohort at the Bristol Interstitial Lung Disease Centre in the UK. Patients diagnosed with IPF between 2007 and 2014 were identified. Longitudinal pulmonary physiology and exercise testing results were collated, with all-cause mortality used as the primary outcome. Factors influencing overall, 12- and 24-month survival were identified using Cox proportional hazards modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We found in this real-world cohort of 167 patients, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and initiation of long-term oxygen were independent markers of poor prognosis. Exercise testing results predicted 12-month mortality as well as DLCO, but did not perform as well for overall survival. The Composite Physiological Index was the best performing multidimensional index, but did not outperform DLCO. Our data confirmed that patients who experienced a fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) {\textgreater}10{\%} had significantly worse survival after that point (p=0.024). Our data from longitudinal follow-up in IPF show that DLCO is the best individual prognostic marker, outperforming FVC. Exercise testing is important in predicting early poor outcome. Regular and complete review should be conducted to ensure appropriate care is delivered in a timely fashion.},

Pathogen detection is mediated by different receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins, and pentraxines. However, little is known about their relevance for immature human dendritic cells (iDCs). Methods: The gene expression pattern of iDCs after exposure to A. fumigatus germ tubes was studied by use of whole genome microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fungal receptors were targeted by means of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which were used to knock down expression of TLR2, TLR4, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin), PTX3 (pentraxin-related gene), dectin-1 (C-type lectin domain family 7, member A), and CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family, member 9). RESULTS: Exposure to A. fumigatus induced expression of cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, as well as genes related to fungal recognition and phagocytosis. Silencing of dectin-1 resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12), which was also reduced by anti-Dectin-1 antibody treatment prior to exposure to A. fumigatus, zymosan, or Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: Dectin-1 was identified as an important receptor for A. fumigatus and C. albicans on human iDCs and was found to be involved in the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine response.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, causes invasive disease in immunocompromised humans. Although monocytes and antigen-specific CD4 T cells contribute to defense against inhaled fungal spores, how these cells interact during infection remains undefined. Investigating the role of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells during fungal infection, we find that A. fumigatus infection induces an influx of chemokine receptor CCR2- and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes into lungs and draining lymph nodes. Depletion of CCR2+cells reduced A. fumigatus conidial transport from lungs to draining lymph nodes, abolished CD4 T cell priming following respiratory challenge, and impaired pulmonary fungal clearance. In contrast, depletion of CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes during systemic fungal infection did not prevent CD4 T cell priming in the spleen. Our findings demonstrate that pulmonary CD4 T cell responses to inhaled spores require CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes and their derivatives, revealing a compartmentally restricted function for these cells in adaptive respiratory immune responses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {Necroptosis is a recently discovered necrotic cell death which is regulated by receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 under the stimulus of death signal and can be inhibited by necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) specifically. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the role of necroptosis in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) and assess the effect of Nec-1 on lung injury in ARDS. Our results found that RIPK1, RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) were abundantly expressed in rat lung tissues of OA-induced ARDS. Nec-1 pretreatment improved pulmonary function and attenuated lung edema dramatically in OA-induced ARDS rats. Furthermore, Nec-1 reduced RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction and down-regulated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signal pathway, and inhibited inflammatory response by reducing neutrophil infiltration and protein leakage into lung tissue in OA-induced ARDS. Collectively, our study proves the intervention of necroptosis in OA-induced ARDS. Moreover, our findings imply that Nec-1 plays an important role in the treatment of ARDS via inhibiting necroptosis and inflammation.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

IL-1ra had little or no influence on the number of cells recovered from the broncho-alveolar lavage. Study of histological sections suggests that IL-1ra globally decreased the proportion of damaged lung and particularly in silica the formation of nodules with a rich content in collagen fibrils. IL-1ra was also effective in reducing the lung hydroxyproline content when given on day 25 after instillation of bleomycin or silica, indicating that it may reverse established PF.

The macrophage/mononuclear phagocyte has been shown to have a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, serving as an important source of growth factors that regulate extracellular matrix synthesis.

Neutralization of IL-13, but not IL-4, attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and levels of C10, suggesting that IL-13 has an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. IL-13 is a potent inducer of C10 in vivo, and neutralization of C10 attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and intrapulmonary macrophage numbers. This suggests that IL-13 has a role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis that is independent of its direct effect on fibroblasts and is evidence for an interaction between Th2 cytokines and specific CC chemokines.},

Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO2-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1–5 min) experiments. We discovered that NO2-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO2-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO2-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO2-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO2-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO2-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat curable diseases such as germinative tumors and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The major limitation of bleomycin therapy is pulmonary toxicity, which can be life threatening in up to 10{\%} of patients receiving the drug. The mechanism of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP) involves oxidative damage, relative deficiency of the deactivating enzyme bleomycin hydrolase, genetic susceptibility, and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, BIP can progress to lung fibrosis. The diagnosis of BIP is established by the combination of systemic symptoms, radiological and histological findings, and respiratory function tests abnormalities, while other disorders should be excluded. Although the diagnosis and pathophysiology of this disease have been better characterized over the past few years, there is no effective therapy for the disease. In general, the clinical picture is extremely complex. A greater understanding of the BIP pathogenesis may lead to the development of new agents capable of preventing or even treating the injury already present. Physicians who prescribe bleomycin must be aware of the potential pulmonary toxicity, especially in the presence of risk factors. This review will focus on BIP, mainly regarding recent advances and perspectives in diagnosis and treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Once the plot is generated, a user can readily go on to many other activities such as performing quantitative ROC analysis and comparisons of tests, using likelihood ratio to revise the probability of disease in individual subjects, selecting decision thresholds, using logistic-regression analysis, using discriminant-function analysis, or incorporating the tool into a clinical strategy by using decision analysis.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, causes invasive disease in immunocompromised humans. Although monocytes and antigen-specific CD4 T cells contribute to defense against inhaled fungal spores, how these cells interact during infection remains undefined. Investigating the role of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells during fungal infection, we find that A. fumigatus infection induces an influx of chemokine receptor CCR2- and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes into lungs and draining lymph nodes. Depletion of CCR2+cells reduced A. fumigatus conidial transport from lungs to draining lymph nodes, abolished CD4 T cell priming following respiratory challenge, and impaired pulmonary fungal clearance. In contrast, depletion of CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes during systemic fungal infection did not prevent CD4 T cell priming in the spleen. Our findings demonstrate that pulmonary CD4 T cell responses to inhaled spores require CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes and their derivatives, revealing a compartmentally restricted function for these cells in adaptive respiratory immune responses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This increase in permeability is currently explained by the temporary appearance of aqueous pores within the cell membrane, a phenomenon termed electroporation. During the past four decades, advances in fundamental and experimental electroporation research have allowed for the translation of electroporation-based technologies to the clinic. In this review, we describe the theory and current applications of electroporation in medicine and then discuss current challenges in electroporation research and barriers to a more extensive spread of these clinical applications.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms of acute lung injury resulting in inflammation and fibrosis are not well estab- lished. Here we investigate the roles of the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) and the common adaptor for Toll/IL-1R signal transduction, MyD88, in this process using a murine model of acute pulmonary injury. Bleomycin insult results in expression of neutrophil and lymphocyte chemotactic factors, chronic inflammation, remodeling, and fibrosis. We demonstrate that these end points were attenuated in the lungs of IL-1R1– and MyD88-defi- cient mice. Further, in bone marrow chimera experiments, bleomycin-induced inflammation required pri- marily MyD88 signaling from radioresistant resident cells. Exogenous rIL-1$\beta$ recapitulated a high degree of bleomycin-induced lung pathology, and specific blockade of IL-1R1 by IL-1 receptor antagonist dramatically reduced bleomycin-induced inflammation. Finally, we found that lung IL-1$\beta$ production and inflammation in response to bleomycin required ASC, an inflammasome adaptor molecule. In conclusion, bleomycin-induced lung pathology required the inflammasome and IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling, and IL-1 represented a critical effec- tor of pathology and therapeutic target of chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating lung disease of unknown aetiology. Genetic variations in the IL1RN gene, encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), have been associated with IPF susceptibility. Several studies investigated the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or single nucleotide polymorphisms rs408392, rs419598 and rs2637988, with variable results. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of polymorphisms in IL1RN on IPF susceptibility and mRNA expression. We performed a meta-analysis of the five case-control studies that investigated an IL1RN polymorphism in IPF in a Caucasian population. In addition, we investigated whether IL1RN mRNA expression was influenced by IL1RN polymorphisms. The VNTR, rs408392 and rs419598 were in tight linkage disequilibrium, with D' {\textgreater} 0.99. Furthermore, rs2637988 was in linkage disequilibrium with the VNTR (D' = 0.90). A haploblock of VNTR*2 and the minor alleles of rs408392and rs419598 was constructed. Meta-analysis revealed that this VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with IPF susceptibility both with an allelic model (odds ratio = 1.42, p = 0.002) and a carriership model (odds ratio = 1.60, p = 0.002). IL1RN mRNA expression was significantly influenced by rs2637988, with lower levels found in carriers of the (minor) GG genotype (p {\textless} 0.001). From this meta-analysis, we conclude that the VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with susceptibility to IPF. In addition, polymorphisms in IL1RN influence IL-1Ra mRNA expression, suggesting that lower levels of IL-1Ra predispose to developing IPF. Together these findings demonstrate that the cytokine IL-1Ra plays a role in IPF pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a common complication of long bone fractures. FES is rare but with significant morbidity and occasional fatalities. Studies of animal models of FES are numerous; however, few studies compare inflammatory reactions in multiple organs. The present study investigated the effect of neutral fat and fatty acids, which cause changes in multiple organs and induce FES. Using rats we evaluated the ratio of lung-to-body weight and conducted histological analyses and quantitative analysis of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in the lungs following intravenous administration of neutral fat or fatty acids. Neutral fat increased the ratio of lung-to-body weight, and neutral fat formed emboli in lung capillaries. The levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1$\beta$), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) in the lungs increased after injection of neutral fat and oleic acid. Analysis of the histologic changes revealed that the highest numbers of fat droplets, occluding the capillaries of the lungs, kidney, heart, and brain formed 12. h after the injection of neutral fat and fat droplets gradually diminished 48. h later. Fat droplets were not detected in any organs after the injection of oleic acid. IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$ levels in the lungs were elevated 9-24. h after the injection of neutral fat, although IL-6 levels peaked at 6. h. After injection of oleic acid, peak levels of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and TNF-$\alpha$ were detected at 6. h, and IL-6 again increased in all organs and plasma at 15. h. Neutral fat, but not fatty acids, formed emboli in the capillaries of multiple organs. These findings suggest that neutral fat increased inflammatory cytokine levels by forming emboli in organ capillaries, particularly in the lungs, while oleic acid augmented inflammatory cytokine levels by stimulating endothelial cells of multiple organs.},

abstract = {Here, we show that apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL), through both innate and adaptive immune processes, potently suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in multiple animal tumor models, including the aggressive B16F10L murine malignant melanoma model. Mice expressing the human apoA1 transgene (A1Tg) exhibited increased infiltration of CD11b(+) F4/80(+) macrophages with M1, anti-tumor phenotype, reduced tumor burden and metastasis, and enhanced survival. In contrast, apoA1-deficient (A1KO) mice showed markedly heightened tumor growth and reduced survival. Injection of human apoA1 into A1KO mice inoculated with tumor cells remarkably reduced both tumor growth and metastasis, enhanced survival, and promoted regression of both tumor and metastasis burden when administered following palpable tumor formation and metastasis development. Studies with apolipoprotein A2 revealed the anti-cancer therapeutic effect was specific to apoA1. In vitro studies ruled out substantial direct suppressive effects by apoA1 or HDL on tumor cells. Animal models defective in different aspects of immunity revealed both innate and adaptive arms of immunity contribute to complete apoA1 anti-tumor activity. This study reveals a potent immunomodulatory role for apoA1 in the tumor microenvironment, altering tumor-associated macrophages from a pro-tumor M2 to an anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Use of apoA1 to redirect in vivo elicited tumor-infiltrating macrophages toward tumor rejection may hold benefit as a potential cancer therapeutic.},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

abstract = {Bleomycin (BLM), an antitumour drug, is known to cause interstitial pneumonia followed by pulmonary fibrosis, and has often been used to produce an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the effect of a nonapeptide thymic hormone, facteur thymique serique (FTS), on the murine lung fibrosis induced by intratracheal instillation of BLM. Treatment with FTS ameliorated BLM-induced fibrotic changes in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the reduced accumulation of hydroxyproline (HP). In addition, FTS suppressed BLM-induced cellular inflammatory response in the lungs, as evidenced by inhibition of increased lung weight, reduced accumulation of inflammatory leucocytes, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, but not macrophages, and less pronounced histopathological changes. Finally, BLM challenge increased the local synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha RANTES, MIP-2 and KC, while administration of FTS suppressed the production of these cytokines, except for MCP-1. These effects of FTS were observed only when mice received intratracheal instillation with BLM. Considered collectively, our results indicated that FTS treatment ameliorated the cellular inflammatory responses and fibrotic changes in the lungs caused by BLM and such inhibition was well correlated with reduced synthesis of several fibrosis-related cytokines, and suggested that FTS may be potentially useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection of C57BL/6 mice is an established model of a chronic pulmonary fungal infection accompanied by an "allergic" response (T2) to the infection, i.e., a model of an allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Our objective was to determine whether IFN-gamma plays a role in regulating the pulmonary T2 immune response in C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice. Long-term pulmonary fungistasis was lost in IFN-gamma knockout (KO) mice, resulting in an increased pulmonary burden of fungi at wk 3. IFN-gamma was required for the early influx of leukocytes into the lungs but was not required later in the infection. By wk 3, eosinophil and macrophage numbers were elevated in the absence of IFN-gamma. The inducible NO synthase to arginase ratio was lower in the lungs of IFN-gamma KO mice and the macrophages had increased numbers of intracellular cryptococci and YM1 crystals, indicative of alternatively activated macrophages in these mice. There was evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in both wild-type and IFN-gamma KO mice by 5 wk postinfection. IFN-gamma production was not required for the development of T2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) producing cells in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes or induction of an IgE response. At a number of time points, T2 cytokine production was enhanced in IFN-gamma KO mice. Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma, C57BL/6 mice develop an augmented allergic response to C. neoformans, including enhanced generation of alternatively activated macrophages, which is accompanied by a switch from a chronic to a progressive pulmonary cryptococcal infection.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients. In the immunocompetent host, inhaled conidia are cleared by alveolar macrophages. The signaling pathways of the alveolar macrophage involved in the clearance of A. fumigatus are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of TLRs in the immune response against A. fumigatus and their contribution to the signaling events triggered in murine alveolar macrophages upon infection with A. fumigatus conidia. Specifically, we examined the MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation and cytokine signaling. Our investigations revealed that immunocompetent TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were not more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis as compared with wild-type mice and that the in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK and p38 was not affected in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 knockout mice following stimulation with conidia. In vivo experiments suggest that ERK was an essential MAPK in the defense against A. fumigatus, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB appeared to play only a secondary role. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLR2/4 recognition and MyD88 signaling are dispensable for the clearance of A. fumigatus under immunocompetent situations. Furthermore, our data stress the important role of ERK activation in innate immunity to A. fumigatus.},

abstract = {Inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages are key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. After tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of rat lung injury was originally developed as a model of fat embolism syndrome. A single intravenous dose of pure OA causes an acute diffuse lung injury, which, in its initial stages, histologically and physiologically resembles human ARDS. Rat lungs acutely injured by intravenous OA manifest increased levels of ICAM-1 within 30-60 min. This study shows that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) can be used in a bioassay to reveal some of the adhesion molecule stimulating activities present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from post-OA-injected rats: (1) There is an as yet unidentified ICAM-1 and ELAM (E Selectin) inducing activity in BALF within 15 min of OA injection that is not TNF alpha; there is very little measurable tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in 15 min BALF (BALF15). (2) BALF15 also stimulates cultured macrophage derived from BALF of normal rat lungs to produce TNF alpha. (3) By 60 min after OA injection, 50-75{\%} of the ICAM-1 and ELAM inducing activity in BALF (BALF60) is TNF alpha; BALF60 contains about 250-280 pg/mL TNF alpha. The other 25-50{\%} adhesion molecule-inducing activity in BALF60 is unidentified. (4) The ICAM-1-inducing activity of pure TNF alpha was equal to that of BALF60 containing equivalent concentrations of TNF alpha. The ELAM inducing activity of pure TNF alpha, however, was about 1/2 that of BALF60 containing equivalent concentrations of TNF alpha. The time courses for ICAM and ELAM stimulation with pure TNF alpha or BALF60 containing equivalent levels of TNF alpha were the same. The identity of the mediators in BALF15 and BALF60 that are not TNF alpha and the mechanisms by which OA injection stimulates cytokine production remain to be elucidated.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with chronic diseases such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Because of constant exposure to this fungus, it is critical for the host to exercise an immediate and decisive immune response to clear fungal spores to ward off disease. In this study, we observed that rapidly after infection by A. fumigatus, alveolar macrophages predominantly express Arginase 1 (Arg1), a key marker of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). The macrophages were also found to express Ym1 and CD206 that are also expressed by AAMs but not NOS2, which is expressed by classically activated macrophages. The expression of Arg1 was reduced in the absence of the known signaling axis, IL-4Ralpha/STAT6, for AAM development. While both Dectin-1 and TLR expressed on the cell surface have been shown to sense A. fumigatus, fungus-induced Arg1 expression in CD11c(+) alveolar macrophages was not dependent on either Dectin-1 or the adaptor MyD88 that mediates intracellular signaling by most TLRs. Alveolar macrophages from WT mice efficiently phagocytosed fungal conidia, but those from mice deficient in Dectin-1 showed impaired fungal uptake. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate-filled liposomes increased fungal burden in infected mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that alveolar macrophages, which predominantly acquire an AAM phenotype following A. fumigatus infection, have a protective role in defense against this fungus.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous mold Aspergillus fumigatus threatens immunosuppressed patients as inducer of lethal invasive aspergillosis. A. fumigatus conidia are airborne and reach the alveoli, where they encounter alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Previous studies reported the importance of the surfactant-producing AEC II during A. fumigatus infection via in vitro experiments using cell lines. We established a negative isolation protocol yielding untouched primary murine AEC II with a purity {\textgreater}90{\%}, allowing ex vivo analyses of the cells, which encountered the mold in vivo. By label-free proteome analysis of AEC II isolated from mice 24h after A. fumigatus or mock infection we quantified 2256 proteins and found 154 proteins to be significantly differentially abundant between both groups (ANOVA p value 0.01, ratio of means {\textgreater}1.5 or 0.67, quantified with {\textgreater}2 peptides). Most of these proteins were higher abundant in the infected condition and reflected a comprehensive activation of AEC II on interaction with A. fumigatus. This was especially represented by proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, hence energy production. However, the most strongly induced protein was the L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) Interleukin 4 induced 1 (IL4I1) with a 42.9 fold higher abundance (ANOVA p value 2.91-10). IL4I1 has previously been found in B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and rare neurons. Increased IL4I1 abundance in AEC II was confirmed by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistology. Furthermore, A. fumigatus infected lungs showed high levels of IL4I1 metabolic products. Importantly, higher IL4I1 abundance was also confirmed in lung tissue from human aspergilloma. Because LAAO are key enzymes for bactericidal product generation, AEC II might actively participate in pathogen defense. We provide insights into proteome changes of primary AEC II thereby opening new avenues to analyze the molecular changes of this central lung cell on infectious threats. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005834.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

Objectives To explore the value of serum metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 7 levels in the differential diagnosis of IPF with other ILD. Methods MMP-1/7 serum levels were measured using Luminex xMAP technology in 139 patients- 47 IPF, 36 non-IPF Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), 14 idiopathic Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (iNSIP), 29 secondary NSIP (secNSIP), 13 stage IV sarcoidosis- and 20 healthy controls, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results MMP-1 was significantly higher in IPF than non-IPF UIP (P =.042) and sarcoidosis (P =.027). MMP-7 was significantly higher in IPF than controls (P {\textless}.001), non-IPF UIP (P =.003), secNSIP (P {\textless}.001), and sarcoidosis (P {\textless}.001). The Area Under the Curve for IPF versus other ILD was 0.63 (95{\%}CI, 0.53-0.73) for MMP-1, 0.73 (95{\%}CI, 0.65-0.81) for MMP-7, and 0.74 (95{\%}CI, 0.66-0.82) for MMP-1/MMP-7 combined. Sensitivity and specificity for MMP-7 cutoff = 3.91 ng/mL was 72.3{\%} and 66.3{\%}, respectively, Positive Predictive Values = 52.3{\%} and Negative Predictive Values = 82.4{\%}. Conclusions MMP-1 and particularly MMP-7 serum levels were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF UIP, the main entity in differential diagnosis. The value of these biomarkers as additional tools in a multidisciplinary approach to IPF diagnosis needs to be considered and further explored.},

abstract = {Humans are genetically unable to produce the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), because of a mutation that occurred after our last common ancestor with great apes. Although Neu5Gc is presumed absent from normal humans, small amounts have been claimed to exist in human tumors and fetal meconium. We have generated an antibody with high specificity and avidity for Neu5Gc. Fetal tissues, normal adult tissues, and breast carcinomas from humans showed reactivity to this antibody, primarily within secretory epithelia and blood vessels. The presence of small amounts of Neu5Gc was confirmed by MS. Absent any known alternate pathway for its synthesis, we reasoned that these small amounts of Neu5Gc might originate from exogenous sources. Indeed, human cells fed with Neu5Gc incorporated it into endogenous glycoproteins. When normal human volunteers ingested Neu5Gc, a portion was absorbed and eliminated in urine, and small quantities were incorporated into newly synthesized glycoproteins. Neu5Gc has never been reported in plants or microbes to our knowledge. We found that Neu5Gc is rare in poultry and fish, common in milk products, and enriched in red meats. Furthermore, normal humans have variable amounts of circulating IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies against Neu5Gc, with the highest levels comparable to those of the previously known anti-alpha-galactose xenoreactive antibodies. This finding represents an instance wherein humans absorb and metabolically incorporate a nonhuman dietary component enriched in foods of mammalian origin, even while generating xenoreactive, and potentially autoreactive, antibodies against the same molecule. Potential implications for human diseases are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Alternative activation of alveolar macrophages is linked to fibrosis following exposure to asbestos. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic M2 phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 ({\textgreater}3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-$\beta$1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Arg(432) and Arg(434) in domain V of MARCO are required for the polarization of macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype as mutation of these residues reduced FIZZ1 expression (17-fold) compared with cells expressing MARCO. These observations demonstrate that a macrophage membrane protein regulates the fibrotic response to lung injury and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention.-Murthy, S., Larson-Casey, J.

abstract = {Almost two billion years of evolution have generated a vast and amazing variety of eukaryotic life with approximately 8.7 million extant species. Growth and reproduction of all of these organisms depend on faithful duplication and distribution of their chromosomes to the newly forming daughter cells in a process called the cell cycle. However, most of what is known today about cell cycle control comes from a few model species that belong to the unikonts; that is, to only one of five 'supergroups' that comprise the eukaryotic kingdom. Recently, analyzing species from distantly related clades is providing insights into general principles of cell cycle regulation and shedding light on its evolution. Here, referring to animal and fungal as opposed to non-unikont systems, especially flowering plants from the archaeplastid supergroup, we compare the conservation of central cell cycle regulator functions, the structure of network topologies, and the evolutionary dynamics of substrates of core cell cycle kinases. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We now demonstrate a major role for CD8+ T cells in a murine model of sterile lung injury. These pulmonary CD8+ T cells differentiate into IL-13-producing Tc2 cells and play a major role in a bleomycin-induced model of fibrosis. Differentiation of these Tc2 cells in the lung requires IL-21, and bleomycin treated IL-21-and IL-21R-deficient mice develop inflammation but not fibrosis. Moreover, IL-21R-expressing CD8+ cells are sufficient to reconstitute the fibrotic response in IL-21R-deficient mice. We further show that the combination of IL-4 and IL-21 skews naive CD8+ T cells to produce IL-21, which, in turn, acts in an autocrine manner to support robust IL-13 production. Our data reveal a novel pathway involved in the onset and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis and identify Tc2 cells as key mediators of fibrogenesis.},

abstract = {The lung is exposed to a vast array of inhaled antigens, particulate matter, and pollution. Cells present in the airways must therefore be maintained in a generally suppressive phenotype so that excessive responses to nonserious irritants do not occur; these result in bystander damage to lung architecture, influx of immune cells to the airways, and consequent impairment of gas exchange. To this end, the resident cells of the lung, which are predominantly macrophages, are kept in a dampened state. However, on occasion the suppression fails and these macrophages overreact to antigenic challenge, resulting in release of inflammatory mediators, induction of death of lung epithelial cells, deposition of extracellular matrix, and development of immunopathology. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms behind this macrophage-mediated pathology, in the context of a number of inflammatory pulmonary disorders.},

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells, from 30 patients with sarcoidosis, 18 patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, and 15 healthy controls, were investigated with flow cytometry for intracellular expression of FoxP3. In a subset of the patients, expression of the cytokines IL17A and IFN- ? was investigated. The fractions of FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells and Th17 cells were both lower in sarcoidosis compared to controls ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.011 , resp.).

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

abstract = {The lung hosts multiple populations of macrophages and dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in lung pathology. The accurate identification and enumeration of these subsets are essential for understanding their role in lung pathology. Flow cytometry is a mainstream tool for studying the immune system. However, a systematic flow cytometric approach to identify subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) accurately and consistently in the normal mouse lung has not been described. Here we developed a panel of surface markers and an analysis strategy that accurately identify all known populations of macrophages and DCs, and their precursors in the lung during steady-state conditions and bleomycin-induced injury. Using this panel, we assessed the polarization of lung macrophages during the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Alveolar macrophages expressed markers of alternatively activated macrophages during both acute and fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury, whereas markers of classically activated macrophages were expressed only during the acute phase. Taken together, these data suggest that this flow cytometric panel is very helpful in identifying macrophage and DC populations and their state of activation in normal, injured, and fibrotic lungs.},

abstract = {The clinical and commercial success of monoclonal antibodies has led to the need for very large-scale production in mammalian cell culture. This has resulted in rapid expansion of global manufacturing capacity [1], an increase in size of reactors (up to 20,000??L) and a greatly increased effort to improve process efficiency with concomitant manufacturing cost reduction. This has been particularly successful in the upstream part of the process where productivity of cell cultures has improved 100??fold in the last 15??years. This success has resulted from improvements in expression technology and from process optimisation, especially the development of fed-batch cultures. In addition to improving process/cost efficiencies, a second key area has been reducing the time taken to develop processes and produce the first material required for clinical testing and proof-of-principle. Cell line creation is often the slowest step in this stage of process development. This article will review the technologies currently used to make monoclonal antibodies with particular emphasis on mammalian cell culture. Likely future trends are also discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive loss of the alveolar integrity, recruitment, and activation of myofibroblast, and excessive collagen deposition that resulted in loss of parenchymal architecture and lung function. Although etiology is unknown, major risk factor of disease development is represented by cigarette smoke or exposure to dust. Aims: Aim of this proteomic study was to compare broncho alveolar lavage fluid protein profiles of IPF patients, never-smoker healthy control (nonsmoker control) and smoker control subjects in order to investigate proteins potentially related to disease progression and pathogenesis. Methods: Broncho alveolar lavage fluid samples were resolved using 2D-PAGE and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by MS. The performed PCA statistically proved the correlation existing between differentially expressed spots in the three groups. Functional analysis of the identified proteins was performed by pathway and enrichment analysis by MetaCore and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Results: Interestingly, transcriptional factors NF-kB, PPARgamma, and c-myc emerged as well as a group of functional hubs. Enrichment analysis suggested that Gene Ontology (GO) process networks and pathway maps involved in IPF included angiotensin system maturation, renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, heme metabolism, coagulation system, response to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and iron transport. Conclusion: In conclusion, the combination of proteomic data with system biology platforms allowed us to amplify the information obtained processing the results and indicated the principal pathways involved. These information can point to potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets opening the way for further analysis.},

The versatility of antibodies is demonstrated by the various functions that they mediate such as neutralization, agglutination, fixation with activation of complement and activation of effector cells. Naturally occurring antibodies protect the organism against harmful pathogens, viruses and infections. In addition, almost any organic chemical induces antibody production of antibodies that would bind specifically to the chemical. These antibodies are often produced from multiple B cell clones and referred to as polyclonal antibodies. In recent years, scientists have exploited the highly evolved machinery of the immune system to produce structurally and functionally complex molecules such as antibodies from a single B clone, heralding the era of monoclonal antibodies. Most of the antibodies currently in the clinic, target components of the immune system, are not curative and seek to alleviate symptoms rather than cure disease. Our group used a novel strategy to identify reparative human monoclonal antibodies distinct from conventional antibodies. In this chapter, we discuss the therapeutic relevance of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in clinic.},

The beneficial effects of IL-17 expression are 30 especially important in the lung where exposure to foreign agents is abundant. IL-17A plays an 31 important role in protection from both extracellular bacteria and fungi as well as viruses that 32 infect cells of the mucosal tracts. IL-17 co-regulated cytokines such as IL-22 are involved in 33 maintaining epithelial cell homeostasis and participate in epithelial cell repair / regeneration 34 following inflammatory insults. Thus, the IL-17 / IL-22 axis is important in both responding to, 35 and recovering from pathogens. However, aberrant or over-expression of IL-17 cytokines 36 contributes to a number of pathologic outcomes including asthma, pneumonitis, and generation 37 or exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis.

abstract = {Background The initiation and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. IL-33, an important cytokine for respiratory diseases, is overexpressed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Objectives We aimed to determine the effects and mechanism of IL-33 on the development and severity of pulmonary fibrosis in murine bleomycin-induced fibrosis.
MethodsLung fibrosis was induced by bleomycin in wild-type or Il33r (St2)-/-C57BL/6 mice treated with the recombinant mature form of IL-33 or anti-IL-33 antibody or transferred with type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). The development and severity of fibrosis was evaluated based on lung histology, collagen levels, and lavage cytology. Cytokine and chemokine levels were quantified by using quantitative PCR, ELISA, and cytometry.
Results IL-33 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells but is induced in macrophages by bleomycin. Bleomycin enhanced the production of the mature but reduced full-length form of IL-33 in lung tissue. ST2 deficiency, anti-IL-33 antibody treatment, or alveolar macrophage depletion attenuated and exogenous IL-33 or adoptive transfer of ILC2s enhanced bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. These pathologic changes were accompanied, respectively, by reduced or increased IL-33, IL-13, TGF-$\beta$1, and inflammatory chemokine production in the lung. Furthermore, IL-33 polarized M2 macrophages to produce IL-13 and TGF-$\beta$1 and induced the expansion of ILC2s to produce IL-13 in vitro and in vivo.
Conclusions IL-33 is a novel profibrogenic cytokine that signals through ST2 to promote the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis by recruiting and directing inflammatory cell function and enhancing profibrogenic cytokine production in an ST2- and macrophage-dependent manner.},

This continually transports toxic chemicals and particles or pathogenic microorganisms deep into the respiratory system, posing a challenge to physicochemical barriers and the local immune system. Thus, complex structures and mechanisms have evolved to recognize and fend off environmental dangers while at the same time allowing efficient gas exchange. Here we review our current knowledge regarding cellular mechanisms of the immune system in context with the highly specialized anatomical features of the airways and especially the alveolar compartment. The focus is on fungal and viral infections, merging anatomical aspects well known to pulmonologists with fundamental immunological concepts. We discuss the specialized morphological constraints of immune cells compressed under a continuous layer of the surfactant lining within alveoli as well as the importance of functional polarization of respiratory tract epithelia. Furthermore, we summarize the different types of innate and adaptive immune cells and their relative contribution to lung homeostasis with respect to localization. Finally, we provide a list of currently unresolved questions with high relevance for the field that might serve as food for thought regarding future research directions.},

Method: Acute lung injury model was induced by tail-intravenous injection of oleic acid 0.13 gkg-1 mixed with 0.4{\%} bovine serum albumin, while the drugs or normal saline were injected 30 minutes beforehand. The experiment was made in the Animal Lab and the Pharmacology Lab of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. One hundred and nine healthy Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group (n = 16), model group (re = 18), 30 mg{\textperiodcentered} kg-1 anisodamine group (n = 18) and three safflor yellow (SY) groups: 290 mg{\textperiodcentered} kg-1(re = 18), 170 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 = 20) and 100 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1(n = 19). The animals were sacrificed after 5 hours of oleic acid injection. The lung morphological changes were observed by optical microscopy and electron microscopy, plasma IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 levels were determined by ELISA, lung index, A index and B index were measured. The data were expressed as (x̄ ± s) and analyzed by One-Way ANOVA after normality and homogeneityof-variance tests by SPSS 10.0 software. A P value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results: Compared with normal group[(41.3± 1.9),(14.2±0.6),(2.99± 0.15),(111 ± 22) $\mu${\textperiodcentered}L-1, (250±46) $\mu$g-L-1], the lung index, A index, B index as well as the plasma levels of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6[(56.8 ±4.5), (20.0± 1.8), (4.18±0.30), (143±52) $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}L-1,(302±64) $\mu$g-L-1] remarkably increased in the model group(P {\textless} 0.01 or P {\textless} 0.05), and the lung morphological changes were obvious, such as: alveolar septum widened, edema existing in interstitial spaces, etc. In the three SY groups and the anisodamine group, the lung morphological changes were ameliorated; the three indexes and the levels of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 were significantly reduced (P {\textless} 0.01 or P {\textless}0.05), compared with the model group.

abstract = {Mouse myeloma NS0 cells widely used in hybridoma technology lack the expression of a major stress protein Hsp70 which is the principal component of the basic cellular defense mechanism. These cells rapidly undergo apoptosis at the late-stationary phase of batch culture following nutrient exhaustion. Since Hsp70 was recently demonstrated to protect cells against numerous apoptotic stimuli, the aim of the present study was to examine the protective potential of the protein expression in engineered myeloma NS0 cells and in resulting hybridomas. Myeloma cells were transfected with the hsp70 gene under beta-actin gene promoter. To imitate harmful conditions that hybridoma or myeloma cells often experience when cultivated in large scale for an antibody production, NS0(wt) and NS0(hsp70) cell cultures were maintained without changing the medium for a few days, and the expression of apoptotic markers has been studied. It was found that long-term cultivation induced apoptosis in original cells manifested by typical nuclei fragmentation, DNA ladders and activation of caspase-3. In contrast, in transfected cells under the same conditions the outcome of apoptosis was postponed for 24 hours. Most relevant was that the fusion of transfected myeloma cells with immune splenocytes resulted in twofold hybridomas output compared with wild-type fusion partner. Almost half of the hybridomas continued to be hsp70-positive and maintained higher robustness in culture. The level of monoclonal antibodies production by hybridoma cells obtained with the use of NS0(wt) and NS0(hsp70) was similar, however, the secreted product was better preserved in culture supernatants of Hsp70-positive cells. It is concluded that transfection of mouse myeloma cells with the hsp70 gene can be a novel means to increase hybridoma yield and reduce the sensitivity of myeloma and hybridoma cells to culture conditions insults accompanying monoclonal antibody production.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

abstract = {Fibrogenesis involves a pathological accumulation of activated fibroblasts and extensive matrix remodeling. Profibrotic cytokines, such as TGF-$\beta$, stimulate fibroblasts to overexpress fibrotic matrix proteins and induce further expression of profibrotic cytokines, resulting in progressive fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a profibrotic cytokine that is indicative of fibroblast activation. Epithelial cells are abundant in the normal lung, but their contribution to fibrogenesis remains poorly defined. Profibrotic cytokines may activate epithelial cells with protein expression and functions that overlap with the functions of active fibroblasts. We found that alveolar epithelial cells undergoing TGF-$\beta$-mediated mesenchymal transition in vitro were also capable of activating lung fibroblasts through production of CTGF. Alveolar epithelial cell expression of CTGF was dramatically reduced by inhibition of Rho signaling. CTGF reporter mice demonstrated increased CTGF promoter activity by lung epithelial cells acutely after bleomycin in vivo. Furthermore, mice with lung epithelial cell-specific deletion of CTGF had an attenuated fibrotic response to bleomycin. These studies provide direct evidence that epithelial cell activation initiates a cycle of fibrogenic effector cell activation during progressive fibrosis. Therapy targeted at epithelial cell production of CTGF offers a novel pathway for abrogating this progressive cycle and limiting tissue fibrosis.},

abstract = {Several studies have implicated fatty-acids as inflammatory regulators, suggesting that there may be a direct role for common dietary fatty-acids in regulating innate immune cells. In humans, a single high-fat meal increases systemic cytokines and leukocytes. In mice, short term high-fat feeding increases adipose tissue (AT) leukocytes and alters the inflammatory profile of AT macrophages. We have seen that short term high fat feeding to C57BL/6J male mice increases palmitic and oleic acid within AT depots, but oleic acid increase is highest in the mesenteric AT (MAT). In vitro, oleic acid increases M2 macrophage markers (CD206, MGL1, and ARG1) in a murine macrophage cell line, while addition of palmitic acid is able to inhibit that increase. Three day supplementation of a chow diet, with oleic acid, induced an increase in M2 macrophage markers in the MAT, but not in the epididymal AT. We tested whether increases in M2 macrophages occur during short term ad lib feeding of a high fat diet, containing oleic acid. Experiments revealed two distinct populations of macrophages were altered by a three day high milk-fat diet. One population, phenotypically intermediate for F4/80, showed diet-induced increases in CD206, an anti-inflammatory marker characteristic of M2 macrophages intrinsic to the AT. Evidence for a second population, phenotypically F4/80(HI)CD11b(HI) macrophages, showed increased association with the MAT following short term feeding that is dependent on the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1. Collectively, we have shown that short term feeding of a high-fat diet changes two population of macrophages, and that dietary oleic acid is responsible for increases in M2 macrophage polarization.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

As a result of this process of sustained attrition to organs, many diseases that involve fibrosis are often progressive conditions and have a poor long-term prognosis. Inflammation is often a prelude to fibrosis, with innate and adaptive immunity involved in both the initiation and regulation of the fibrotic process.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Invasive aspergillosis is a worldwide disease that primarily affects immune-compromised patients, agricultural workers with corneal abrasions, individuals with structural lung disease, and patients with primary immune deficiency. The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets. The strength and efficacy of the host response is shaped by the tissue microenvironment. In preclinical models of disease, host immune augmentation strategies have yielded benefits, yet translating these insights into therapeutic strategies in humans remains challenging. SUMMARY Although advances in early diagnostic strategies and in antifungal drugs have ameliorated clinical outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, further improvements depend on gaining deeper insight into and translating advances in anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

abstract = {The lung hosts multiple populations of macrophages and dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in lung pathology. The accurate identification and enumeration of these subsets are essential for understanding their role in lung pathology. Flow cytometry is a mainstream tool for studying the immune system. However, a systematic flow cytometric approach to identify subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) accurately and consistently in the normal mouse lung has not been described. Here we developed a panel of surface markers and an analysis strategy that accurately identify all known populations of macrophages and DCs, and their precursors in the lung during steady-state conditions and bleomycin-induced injury. Using this panel, we assessed the polarization of lung macrophages during the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Alveolar macrophages expressed markers of alternatively activated macrophages during both acute and fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury, whereas markers of classically activated macrophages were expressed only during the acute phase. Taken together, these data suggest that this flow cytometric panel is very helpful in identifying macrophage and DC populations and their state of activation in normal, injured, and fibrotic lungs.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors and the beta-glucan receptor, dectin-1, mediate macrophage inflammatory responses to Aspergillus fumigatus through MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms; however, pulmonary inflammatory responses in MyD88-deficient mice challenged with A. fumigatus are poorly defined. The role of MyD88 signaling in early pulmonary inflammation and fungal clearance was evaluated in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and MyD88-deficient (MyD88-/-) mice. Early ({\textless}48 h) after infection, MyD88-/- mice had higher fungal burdens than those of WT mice, although fungal burdens rapidly declined ({\textgreater}72 h) in both. MyD88-/- mice had less consolidated inflammation, with fewer NK cells, in lung tissue early (24 h) after infection than did WT mice. At the latter time point, MyD88-/- mouse lungs were characterized by a large amount of necrotic cellular debris and fibrin, while WT lungs had organized inflammation. Although there were equivalent numbers of macrophages in WT and MyD88-/- mouse lung tissues, MyD88-/- cells demonstrated delayed uptake of green fluorescent protein-expressing A. fumigatus (GFP-Af293); histologically, MyD88-/- mouse lungs had more hyphal invasion of terminal airways and vessels, the appearance of bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis, and necrotizing vasculitis. MyD88-/- lung homogenates contained comparatively decreased amounts of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, KC, and gamma interferon and paradoxically increased amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha. These data indicate that the MyD88-dependent pathway mediates acute pulmonary fungal clearance, inflammation, and tissue injury very early after infection. Resolution of abnormalities within a 3-day window demonstrates the importance of redundant signaling pathways in mediating pulmonary inflammatory responses to fungi.},

As a role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been discussed, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be involved in the initiation of a first immune reaction. We analyzed expression and functional relevance of several TLRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. In parallel, we determined the release of C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 by BAL cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 1 and 2, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR9 expression by BAL cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Chemokine release was measured in BAL cell culture supernatants by ELISA. We found increased TLR9 mRNA expression in patients with sarcoidosis with chest X-ray type I and II and TLR9 protein expression in BAL cells from patients with chest X-ray type II and III. Stimulation with CpG nucleotides increased CXCL10 release by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis type II significantly compared with control subjects or other patients with sarcoidosis. In contrast, no increase in TNF, IL-12p40, or CXCL8 was detected. Spontaneous release of CXCL10, but not CXCL9 or CXCL11, by cultured BAL cells was also highest in cells from patients with chest X-ray type II. We found a significant association between TLR9 expression and CD4(+) lymphocytes in BAL. Our data demonstrate that TLR9 ligands may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis via induction of CXCL10 release in the alveolar macrophages.},

abstract = {The preclinical model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has incorrectly predicted efficacy for several candidate compounds suggesting that it may be of limited value. As an attempt to improve the predictive nature of this model, integrative bioinformatic approaches were used to compare molecular alterations in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and patients with IPF. Using gene set enrichment analysis we show for the first time that genes differentially expressed during the fibrotic phase of the single challenge bleomycin model were significantly enriched in the expression profiles of IPF patients. The genes that contributed most to the enrichment were largely involved in mitosis, growth factor, and matrix signaling. Interestingly, these same mitotic processes were increased in the expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from rapidly progressing, but not slowly progressing, IPF patients relative to control subjects. The data also indicated that TGF$\beta$ was not the sole mediator responsible for the changes observed in this model since the ALK-5 inhibitor SB525334 effectively attenuated some but not all of the fibrosis associated with this model. Although some would suggest that repetitive bleomycin injuries may more effectively model IPF-like changes, our data do not support this conclusion. Together, these data highlight that a single bleomycin instillation effectively replicates several of the specific pathogenic molecular changes associated with IPF, and may be best used as a model for patients with active disease.},

abstract = {Activation of the innate immune system plays a key role in exacerbations of chronic lung disease, yet the potential role of lung fibroblasts in innate immunity and the identity of epithelial danger signals (alarmins) that may contribute to this process are unclear. The objective of the study was to identify lung epithelial-derived alarmins released during endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and oxidative stress and evaluate their potential to induce innate immune responses in lung fibroblasts. We found that treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs) with conditioned media from damaged lung epithelial cells significantly upregulated interleukin IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression (P{\textless}0.05). This effect was reduced with anti-IL-1$\alpha$ or IL-1Ra but not anti-IL-1$\beta$ antibody. Costimulation with a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), significantly accentuated the IL-1$\alpha$-induced inflammatory phenotype in PHLFs, and this effect was blocked with inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta and TGF$\beta$-activated kinase-1 inhibitors. Finally, Il1r1-/- and Il1a-/- mice exhibit reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophilia and collagen deposition in response to bleomycin treatment. We conclude that IL-1$\alpha$ plays a pivotal role in triggering proinflammatory responses in fibroblasts and this process is accentuated in the presence of double-stranded RNA. This mechanism may be important in the repeated cycles of injury and exacerbation in chronic lung disease.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered the most common and severe form of the disease, with a median survival of approximately three years and no proven effective therapy. Despite the fact that effective treatments are absent and the precise mechanisms that drive fibrosis in most patients remain incompletely understood, an extensive body of scientific literature regarding pulmonary fibrosis has accumulated over the past 35 years. In this review, we discuss three broad areas which have been explored that may be responsible for the combination of altered lung fibroblasts, loss of alveolar epithelial cells, and excessive accumulation of ECM: inflammation and immune mechanisms, oxidative stress and oxidative signaling, and procoagulant mechanisms. We discuss each of these processes separately to facilitate clarity, but certainly significant interplay will occur amongst these pathways in patients with this disease.},

abstract = {The Cas9 protein (CRISPR-associated protein 9), derived from type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) bacterial immune systems, is emerging as a powerful tool for engineering the genome in diverse organisms. As an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9 can be easily programmed to target new sites by altering its guide RNA sequence, and its development as a tool has made sequence-specific gene editing several magnitudes easier. The nuclease-deactivated form of Cas9 further provides a versatile RNA-guided DNA-targeting platform for regulating and imaging the genome, as well as for rewriting the epigenetic status, all in a sequence-specific manner. With all of these advances, we have just begun to explore the possible applications of Cas9 in biomedical research and therapeutics. In this review, we describe the current models of Cas9 function and the structural and biochemical studies that support it. We focus on the applications of Cas9 for genome editing, regulation, and imaging...},

abstract = {The bleomycin-induced rodent lung fibrosis model is commonly used to study mechanisms of lung fibrosis and to test potential therapeutic interventions, despite the well recognized dissimilarities to human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify genomic commonalities between the gene expression profiles from 100 IPF lungs and 108 control lungs that were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, and rat lungs harvested at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 after bleomycin instillation. Surprisingly, the highest gene expression similarity between bleomycin-treated rat and IPF lungs was observed at Day 7. At this point of maximal rat-human commonality, we identified a novel set of 12 disease-relevant translational gene markers (C6, CTHRC1, CTSE, FHL2, GAL, GREM1, LCN2, MMP7, NELL1, PCSK1, PLA2G2A, and SLC2A5) that was able to separate almost all patients with IPF from control subjects in our cohort and in two additional IPF/control cohorts (GSE10667 and GSE24206). Furthermore, in combination with diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide measurements, four members of the translational gene marker set contributed to stratify patients with IPF according to disease severity. Significantly, pirfenidone attenuated the expression change of one (CTHRC1) translational gene marker in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, in transforming growth factor-$\beta$1-treated primary human lung fibroblasts and transforming growth factor-$\beta$1-treated human epithelial A549 cells. Our results suggest that a strategy focused on rodent model-human disease commonalities may identify genes that could be used to predict the pharmacological impact of therapeutic interventions, and thus facilitate the development of novel treatments for this devastating lung disease.},

abstract = {Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in type 2 immunity. Mice deficient in ST2, a receptor for the latest member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, have impaired type 2 immune responses. We therefore reasoned that IL-33/ST2 signaling may be involved in the differentiation and activation of AAM during airway inflammation. We report here that IL-33 changed the quiescent phenotype of alveolar macrophages toward an AAM phenotype that expressed mannose receptor, IL-4Ralpha, and produced high levels of CCL24 and CCL17 in an IL-13-dependent manner during IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Neutralization of AAM-derived CCL24 led to an amelioration of IL-33-induced eosinophilia in the lungs. Moreover, depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Additionally, the attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation in ST2(-/-) mice was associated with a decrease in AAM differentiation. In vitro, IL-33 amplified IL-13-induced polarization of alveolar- and bone marrow-derived macrophage toward an AAM phenotype by increasing the expression of arginase I, Ym1, as well as the production of CCL24 and CCL17. IL-13/IL-4Ralpha signaling was crucial for IL-33-driven AAM amplification by inducing the expression of ST2L. Finally, we showed that IL-33 was more abundantly expressed in the lung epithelial cells of asthma patients than those from healthy controls, suggesting that IL-33 may be involved in lung macrophage activation in clinical asthma. Taken together, we demonstrate here that IL-33/ST2 plays a significant role in the amplification of AAM polarization and chemokine production which contribute to innate and Ag-induced airway inflammation.},

abstract = {A large variety of fungi are present in the environment, among which a proportion colonizes the human body, usually without causing any harm. However, depending on the host immune status, commensals can become opportunistic pathogens that induce diseases ranging from superficial non-harmful infection to life-threatening systemic disease. The interplay between the host and the fungal commensal flora is being orchestrated by an efficient recognition of the microorganisms, which in turn ensures a proper balance between tolerance of the normal fungal flora and induction of immune defense mechanisms when invasion occurs. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a significant role in maintaining this balance due to their capacity to sense fungi and induce host responses such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines involved in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In the present review, we will discuss the most recent findings regarding the recognition of Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus and the different types of immune cells that play a role in antifungal host defense.},

abstract = {Organ fibrosis, the result of exaggerated, persistent, and often irreversible accumulation of extracellular matrix, complicates numerous diseases in all organs and tissues and has particularly serious consequences in the lungs. Abnormally accumulating scar tissue both replaces normally functioning parenchyma and distorts the architecture of unaffected tissue. In the lungs, the fibrotic process often leads to rapid and severe abnormalities in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange properties. There is no confirmed cure, and better therapies are required for treating fibrosis. The development of therapeutic strategies compels a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis, which are diverse, complex, and redundant. Epithelial injury, oxidative stress, coagulation disturbances, and inflammation are engaged in a complex interplay leading to augmented transformation of several cell types into myofibroblasts and prolonged survival of these extracellular matrix-producing cells. Cytokines are centrally engaged in the homeostatic and pathophysiologic regulation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it appears that identical cytokines are utilized by inflammation, profibrotic mechanisms, and the fibrotic process itself, suggesting that specific targeting or utilization of these cytokines holds therapeutic promise. In this article, we review the wealth of recent knowledge on major cytokines involved in the fibrotic process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes in time course RNA-Seq data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of transcriptional regulatory network. However, most of the available methods treat gene expressions at different time points as replicates and test the significance of the mean expression difference between treatments or conditions irrespective of time. They thus fail to identify many DE genes with different profiles across time. In this article, we propose a negative binomial mixed-effect model (NBMM) to identify DE genes in time course RNA-Seq data. In the NBMM, mean gene expression is characterized by a fixed effect, and time dependency is described by random effects. The NBMM is very flexible and can be fitted to both unreplicated and replicated time course RNA-Seq data via a penalized likelihood method. By comparing gene expression profiles over time, we further classify the DE genes into two subtypes to enhance the understanding of expression dynamics. A significance test for detecting DE genes is derived using a Kullback-Leibler distance ratio. Additionally, a significance test for gene sets is developed using a gene set score. RESULTS Simulation analysis shows that the NBMM outperforms currently available methods for detecting DE genes and gene sets. Moreover, our real data analysis of fruit fly developmental time course RNA-Seq data demonstrates the NBMM identifies biologically relevant genes which are well justified by gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method is powerful and efficient to detect biologically relevant DE genes and gene sets in time course RNA-Seq data.},

We have carried out the first functional evaluation of PMLC subpopulations in the inflamed lung, following the isolation of these cells, and other lineages, from BAL fluid using novel and complex protocols. METHODS: iPMLC, rPMLC, alveolar macrophages (AM), neutrophils, and regulatory T cells were quantified in BAL fluid of healthy subjects at 9 hours post-LPS inhalation (n = 15). Cell surface antigen expression by iPMLC, rPMLC and AM and the ability of each lineage to proliferate and to undergo phagocytosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Basal cytokine production by iPMLC compared to AM following their isolation from BAL fluid and the responsiveness of both cell types following in vitro treatment with the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone were assessed. RESULTS: rPMLC have a significantly increased expression of mature macrophage markers and of the proliferation antigen Ki67, compared to iPMLC. Our cytokine data revealed a pro-inflammatory, corticosteroid-resistant phenotype of iPMLC in this model.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with aberrant expression of developmental pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh). As Hh signalling contributes to multiple pro-fibrotic processes, Hh inhibition may represent a therapeutic option for IPF. However, no non-invasive biomarkers are available to monitor lung Hh activity. METHODS We assessed gene and protein expression in IPF and control lung biopsies, mouse lung, fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with sonic hedgehog (SHh), and plasma in IPF patients versus controls, and cancer patients before and after treatment with vismodegib, a Hh inhibitor. RESULTS Lung tissue from IPF patients exhibited significantly greater expression of Hh-related genes versus controls. The gene most significantly upregulated in both IPF lung biopsies and fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with SHh was CXCL14, which encodes a soluble secreted chemokine whose expression is inhibited in vitro by the addition of vismodegib. CXCL14 expression was induced by SHh overexpression in mouse lung. Circulating CXCL14 protein levels were significantly higher in plasma from IPF patients than controls. In cancer patients, circulating CXCL14 levels were significantly reduced upon vismodegib treatment. CONCLUSIONS CXCL14 is a systemic biomarker that could be used to identify IPF patients with increased Hh pathway activity and monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of Hh antagonist therapy in IPF.

abstract = {Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissue or organ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of proteases known to regulate the turn-over of ECM and so they are suggested to be important in tissue remodelling observed during fibrogenic process associated with chronic inflammation. Tissue remodelling is the result of an imbalance in the equilibrium of the normal processes of synthesis and degradation of ECM components markedly controlled by the MMPs/TIMP imbalance. We previously showed an association of the differences in collagen deposition in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with a reduced molar pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. Using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) preclinical model of liver fibrosis in mice, we observed a significant increase in collagen deposition with increased expression and release of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 both at 24 h and 3 weeks later. This suggests an early altered regulation of matrix turnover involved in the development of fibrosis. We also demonstrated an activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway associated with the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling in the development of experimental fibrosis both in lung and liver. This was also associated with an increased expression of purinergic receptors mainly P2X7 Finally, these observations emphasize those effective therapies for these disorders must be given early in the natural history of the disease, prior to the development of tissue remodelling and fibrosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The analysis of lung artefacts has gained increasing importance as markers of lung pathology. B-line artefact (BLA), caused by a reverberation phenomenon, is the most important lung artefact. In this review, we discuss the current role of BLA in pneumology and explore open questions of the published consensus. METHODS We summarized current literature about BLA. Also, we presented observations on healthy subjects and patients with interstitial syndrome (pulmonary fibrosis and edema), to investigate technical factors influencing BLA visualization. RESULTS BLA imaging is influenced by more factors than recently assumed. When multiple BLA is visualized in the lung, they represent a sign of increased density due to the loss of aeration in the lung periphery. This condition may indicate different diseases including cardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse or focal interstitial lung diseases (ILD), infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Correct interpretation of BLA in lung ultrasound is strongly influenced by associated sonographic signs and careful integration of all relevant clinical information. CONCLUSIONS BLA is useful to monitor clinical response, and may become crucial in directing the diagnostic process. Further research is warranted to clarify technical adjustments, different probe and machine factors that influence the visualization of BLA.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

abstract = {I n an interesting paper, Scotton et al. (1) reported the ef-fects of IL-13 on the transcriptional profile of human monocytes. Comparing their results with studies analyz-ing the profile induced by IL-4 in murine macrophages (2, 3), the authors notice some differences, giving as examples up-reg-ulation of Ym1 and arginase-1 in murine macrophages, but not in human monocytes. The authors suggest these differences re-flect the fact that IL-4 and IL-13 are highly similar, yet different molecules. Besides overlapping effects with IL-4, IL-13 indeed has documented nonredundant functions and effects (4, 5). However, when comparing results obtained in murine macro-phages to human monocytes, differences between monocytes and differentiated macrophages, as well as interspecies differ-ences, may be involved. Indeed, human monocytes and mono-cyte-derived macrophages exhibit differences in their response to IL-4 and IL-13 (6). Moreover, we and others recently docu-mented that, similar to IL-13, IL-4 does not induce arginase-1 in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (7, 8), in contrast to murine macrophages, where the arginine me-tabolism is even one of the discriminative criteria between so-called alternatively and classically activated macrophages (9). Furthermore, in human monocytes, under conditions inducing mannose receptor and macrophage galactose-type C-type lec-tin, markers for IL-4/IL-13-induced, alternatively activated macrophages (7), we have not detected induction by IL-4 and IL-13 of eosinophil chemotactic cytokine, the closest human homolog of mouse Ym1 by sequence identity (Fig. 1). Overall, next to similarities, murine and human alternatively activated myeloid cells exhibit distinct differences. These should be taken into consideration to make optimal use of information obtained from murine models, and to relate it to the human situation.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a key component of high-density lipoproteins that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from cells and reduces vascular inflammation. We investigated whether endogenous apoA-I modulates ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation in mice. We found that apoA-I expression was significantly reduced in the lungs of OVA-challenged, compared with saline-challenged, wild-type (WT) mice. Next, to investigate the role of endogenous apoA-I in the pathogenesis of OVA-induced airway inflammation, WT and apoA-I(-/-) mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of OVA and aluminum hydroxide, followed by multiple nasal OVA challenges for 4 weeks. OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice exhibited a phenotype of increased airway neutrophils compared with WT mice, which could be rescued by an administration of a 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Multiple pathways promoted neutrophilic inflammation in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, including the up-regulated expression of (1) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A and TNF-$\alpha$), (2) CXC chemokines (CXCL5), (3) vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and (4) granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). Because concentrations of G-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly increased in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, we hypothesized that enhanced G-CSF expression may represent the predominant pathway mediating increased neutrophilic inflammation. This was confirmed by the intranasal administration of a neutralizing anti-G-CSF antibody, which significantly reduced BALF neutrophilia by 72{\%} in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, compared with mice that received a control antibody. We conclude that endogenous apoA-I negatively regulates OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, primarily via a G-CSF-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, these findings suggest that apoA-I may play an important role in modulating the severity of neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.},

abstract = {We describe a novel approach named REAL-Select for the non-covalent display of IgG-molecules on the surface of yeast cells for the purpose of antibody engineering and selection. It relies on the capture of secreted native full-length antibodies on the cell surface via binding to an externally immobilized ZZ domain, which tightly binds antibody Fc. It is beneficial for high-throughput screening of yeast-displayed IgG-libraries during antibody discovery and development. In a model experiment, antibody-displaying yeast cells were isolated from a 1:1,000,000 mixture with control cells confirming the maintenance of genotype-phenotype linkage. Antibodies with improved binding characteristics were obtained by affinity maturation using REAL-Select, demonstrating the ability of this system to display antibodies in their native form and to detect subtle changes in affinity by flow cytometry. The biotinylation of the cell surface followed by functionalization with a streptavidin-ZZ fusion protein is an approach that is independent of the genetic background of the antibody-producing host and therefore can be expected to be compatible with other eukaryotic expression hosts such as P. pastoris or mammalian cells.},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 3.77 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 and 94.3{\%} accuracy. Cut-off values of 4.66 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 2.52 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 possessed 99.4 and 93.2{\%} accuracy for differentiating among the IPF and other interstitial lung disease groups. Conclusions: Innate immune responses may be associated with the development of IPF. Furthermore, the IL-33 and TSLP levels in BAL fluids may be useful for differentiating IPF from other chronic interstitial lung diseases.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a heterogeneous macrophage response that when experimentally polarized toward alternative forms of activation (M2 macrophages) promotes tissue and functional recovery. There are limited pharmacological therapies that can drive this reparative inflammatory state. In the current study, we used in vitro systems to comprehensively defined markers of macrophages with known pathological (M1) and reparative (M2) properties in SCI. We then used these markers to objectively define the macrophage activation states after SCI in response to delayed azithromycin treatment. Mice were subjected to moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI. Azithromycin or vehicle was administered beginning 30 minutes post-SCI and then daily for 3 or 7 days post injury (dpi). We detected a dose-dependent polarization toward purportedly protective M2 macrophages with daily AZM treatment. Specifically, AZM doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg decreased M1 macrophage gene expression at 3 dpi while the lowest (10 mg/kg) and highest (160 mg/kg) doses increased M2 macrophage gene expression at 7 dpi. Azithromycin has documented immunomodulatory properties and is commonly prescribed to treat infections in SCI individuals. This work demonstrates the utility of objective, comprehensive macrophage gene profiling for evaluating immunomodulatory SCI therapies and highlights azithromycin as a promising agent for SCI treatment. Spinal cord injury (SCI) activates CNS macrophages consisting of endogenous microglia and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells have pathological properties and contribute to neurodegeneration and tissue loss subsequent to the initial mechanical trauma. Activated macrophages also have the potential to promote tissue remodeling and axon regeneration 1–3 and there is growing evidence that transgenic, viral, or transplantation-mediated alterations in macrophage phenotype in SCI can be therapeutic 4 . The development of clinically viable, pharmacological interventions that harness the reparative potential of macrophages responding to SCI, however, remains a challenge facing the SCI community. To date, only one pharmacological agent, meth-ylprednisolone, is approved to treat SCI and its use is controversial. Increasingly, well-tolerated, pharmacological agents with immunomodulatory properties are being sought as therapies for SCI. Azithromycin (AZM) is a semisynthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin with significant immunomodulatory actions independent of is antibacterial properties 5,6},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

Methods: We recruited 15 patients with various stages of sarcoidosis and 12 healthy controls. All subjects underwent bronchoscopy with lavage. For each subject, total RNA was extracted from BAL cells and hybridized to an Affymetrix U133A microarray. Rigorous statistical methods were applied to identify differential gene expression between subjects with sarcoidosis vs. controls. To better elucidate pathways differentially activated between these groups, we integrated network and gene set enrichment analyses of BAL cell transcriptional profiles. Results: Sarcoidosis patients were either non-smokers or former smokers, all had lung involvement and only two were on systemic prednisone. Healthy controls were all non-smokers. Comparison of BAL cell gene expression between sarcoidosis and healthy subjects revealed over 1500 differentially expressed genes. Several previously described immune mediators, such as interferon gamma, were upregulated in the sarcoidosis subjects. Using an integrative computational approach we constructed a modular network of over 80 gene sets that were highly enriched in patients with sarcoidosis. Many of these pathways mapped to inflammatory and immune-related processes including adaptive immunity, T-cell signaling, graft vs. host disease, interleukin 12, 23 and 17 signaling. Additionally, we uncovered a close association between the proteasome machinery and adaptive immunity, highlighting a potentially important and targetable relationship in the pathobiology of sarcoidosis. Conclusions: BAL cells in sarcoidosis are characterized by enrichment of distinct transcriptional programs involved in immunity and proteasomal processes. Our findings add to the growing evidence implicating alveolar resident immune effector cells in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and identify specific pathways whose activation may modulate disease progression.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a growing clinical problem which can result in breathlessness or respiratory failure and has an average life expectancy of 3 years from diagnosis. Therapeutic options for PF are limited and there is therefore a significant unmet clinical need. The recent resurgent interest in macrophage biology has led to a new understanding of lung macrophage origins, biology, and phenotypes. In this review we discuss fibrotic mechanisms and focus on the role of macrophages during fibrotic lung disease. Data from both human and murine studies are reviewed, highlighting novel macrophage-orientated biomarkers for disease diagnosis and potential targets for future anti-fibrotic therapies.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

Only a few hundred mRNA transcripts stood out as selectively expressed by macrophages over DCs and many of these were not present in all macrophages. Nonetheless, well-characterized surface markers, including MerTK and Fc$\gamma$R1 (CD64), along with a cluster of novel transcripts were distinctly and universally associated with mature tissue macrophages. TCEF3, C/EBP$\alpha$, BACH1, and CREG-1 were among the top transcriptional regulators predicted to regulate these core macrophage- associated genes.

We further illustrate how these transcripts and the proteins they encode facilitate distinguishing macrophage versus DC identity of less characterized populations of mononuclear phagocytes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease defined by the presence of nonnecrotizing granuloma in the absence of any known cause. Although clinically, the heterogeneity of sarcoidosis is well characterized, the transcriptome of the sarcoidosis and underlying molecular mechanisms are not. The signal of all transcripts, small and long noncoding RNAs, can be detected using microarrays or RNA-Sequencing. Analyzing the transcriptome of tissues that are directly affected by granulomas is of great importance to understand biology of the disease and may be predictive of disease and treatment outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple genome wide expression studies performed on sarcoidosis affected tissues were published in the last 11 years. Published studies focused to examine differences in gene expression levels between sarcoidosis vs. control tissues, stable vs. progressive form of sarcoidosis, as well as sarcoidosis vs. other diseases. Strikingly, all these transcriptomics data confirm the key role of TH1 immune response in sarcoidosis and particularly of interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) and type I IFN-driven signaling pathways. SUMMARY First steps toward transcriptomics of sarcoidosis in precision medicine are taken and highlight the potentials of this approach. Large prospective follow-up studies are required to identify signatures predictive of disease progression and outcome.},

Ten-week-old Wistar male rats were divided into four groups: (1) oleic acid injected into caudal vein after heat exposure, (2) oleic acid injected without heat exposure, (3) soybean oil injected after heat exposure, and (4) soybean oil injected without heat exposure, and then mRNA expression of eight inflammatory mediators related to ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in lung was determined 1. h after the injection. mRNA expression of interleukin 1 beta (Il1b), tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa), transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1) and Hsp70 was significantly increased by heat exposure, while that of Il1b, interleukin 6 (Il6), Tnfa, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (Mip2) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (Gm-csf) was significantly elevated by the injection of oleic acid. Moreover, the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung almost paralleled their mRNA expressions. In particular, IL-1$\beta$ expression was synergistically elevated by heat exposure followed by injection of oleic acid. Additionally, IL-6 expression tended to increase under the same conditions as well. It is likely that heat exposure itself injures lung tissue within a short time, and that more than two conditions which induce ALI/ARDS interact with each other synergistically, exacerbating the development of ALI/ARDS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Emerging roles are being recognized increasingly for apolipoproteins in the pathogenesis and treatment of lung diseases on the basis of their ability to suppress inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling, and to promote adaptive immunity and host defense. Apolipoproteins, such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), are important components of lipoprotein particles that facilitate the transport of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids between plasma and cells. ApoE- containing lipoprotein particles are internalized into cells by low- density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs), whereas apoA-I can interact with the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) transporter to efflux cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells. ApoE and apoA-I also mediate receptor-independent effects, such as binding to and neutralizing LPS. Both apoE and apoA-I are expressed by lung cells, which allows apoE/LDLR- and apoA-I/ABCA1- dependent pathways to modulate normal lung health and the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, including asthma, acute lung injury, cancer, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Data from human studies and research using experimental murine model systems have shown that both apoE and apoA-I pathways play primarily protective roles in lung biology and respiratory disease. Furthermore, apolipoprotein mimetic peptides, corresponding to the LDLR-binding domain of apoE or the class A amphipathic a-helical structure of apoA-I, have antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects that attenuate the severity of lung disease in murine models. Thus, the development of inhaled apolipoprotein mimetic peptides as a novel treatment paradigm could represent a significant advance for patients with respiratory disease who do not respond to current therapies.},

abstract = {Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains a major cause of morbidity in immunocompromised hosts. This is due to the inability of the host immunity to respond appropriately to Aspergillus. An established risk factor for IA is neutropenia which is encountered by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Herein we investigate the role of neutrophils in modulating host response to Aspergillus. We found that neutrophils had the propensity to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production but through different mechanisms for specific cytokines. Cellular contact was requisite for the modulation of interleukin-1 beta production by Aspergillus with the involvement of complement receptor 3. On the other hand, inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production (TNF-$\alpha$) was cell contact-independent and mediated by secreted myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specifically, the inhibition of TNF-$\alpha$ by MPO was through the TLR4 pathway and involved interference with the mRNA transcription of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) / interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). Our study illustrates the extended immune modulatory role of neutrophils beyond its primary phagocytic function. The absence of neutrophils and loss of its inhibitory effect on cytokine production explains the hypercytokinemia seen in neutropenic patients when infected with Aspergillus.},

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-13 is a major inducer of fibrosis in many chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. In studies of the mechanisms underlying such induction, we found that IL-13 induces transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 in macrophages through a two-stage process involving, first, the induction of a receptor formerly considered to function only as a decoy receptor, IL-13R2. Such induction requires IL-13 (or IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. Second, it involves IL-13 signaling through IL-13R2 to activate an AP-1 variant containing c-jun and Fra-2, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter. In vivo, we found that prevention of IL-13R2 expression reduced production of TGF-1 in oxazolone-induced colitis and that prevention of IL-13R2 expression, Il13ra2 gene silencing or blockade of IL-13R2 signaling led to marked downregulation of TGF-1 production and collagen deposition in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. These data suggest that IL-13R2 signaling during prolonged inflammation is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of TGF-1–mediated fibrosis.},

Human erythrocytes, for this reason, have been used as convenient model cells to study toxic properties of the OA complexes. The toxicity of HAMLET-like complexes, prepared using immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) isolated from the sera of rabbits immunized with human erythrocytes as well as those unimmunized, towards the red cells was investigated. The OA complex of the IgG prepared by the heat-treatment procedure comprised of protein monomers and oligomers with bound OA. The IgG in the complexes retained most secondary but only partial tertiary structure and complex formation with OA did not abolish the ability of anti-erythrocyte IgG to bind to the erythrocytes. Anti-erythrocyte IgG-OA complexes were remarkably more hemolytic than those prepared using non-specific IgG, while complexes prepared using affinity purified anti-erythrocyte IgG were most effective in hemolyzing the cells. The work suggests that antibodies that exhibit affinity towards target cells may be useful in the preparation of selective and highly toxic OA complexes for the cells.},

Although AKT2-mediated signaling pathways modulate inflammatory responses, their role in IPF has not been defined. We report that AKT2 deficiency (Akt2(-/-)) protected against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. Adoptive transfer of wild-type macrophages or administration of IL-13 to Akt2(-/-) mice could restore pulmonary fibrosis. In response to IL-33 treatment, Akt2(-/-) macrophages displayed decreased production of IL-13 and TGF-$\beta$1 and attenuated phosphorylation of FoxO3a compared with Akt2(+/+) macrophages. Furthermore, the expression of IL-13 was increased by small interfering RNA knockdown of FoxO3a or in FoxO3a-deficient macrophages. By evaluating lung sections from pulmonary fibrosis patients, we found that the phosphorylation of AKT2 and FoxO3a was remarkably upregulated. Collectively, these results indicate that AKT2 modulates pulmonary fibrosis through inducing TGF-$\beta$1 and IL-13 production by macrophages, and inhibition of AKT2 may be a potential strategy for treating IPF.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening, interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. The median survival of patients with IPF is only 2 to 3 years, yet some patients live much longer. Respiratory failure resulting from disease progression is the most frequent cause of death. To date we have limited information as to predictors of mortality in patients with IPF, and research in this area has failed to yield prediction models that can be reliably used in clinical practice to predict individual risk of mortality. The goal of this concise clinical review is to examine and summarize the current data on the clinical course, individual predictors of survival, and proposed clinical prediction models in IPF. Finally, we will discuss challenges and future directions related to predicting survival in IPF.},

Now, evidence is accumulating that IL-33 also potently stimulates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), regulatory T (Treg) cells, TH1 cells, CD8(+) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. This pleiotropic nature is reflected in the role of IL-33 in tissue and metabolic homeostasis, infection, inflammation, cancer and diseases of the central nervous system. In this Review, we highlight the molecular and cellular characteristics of IL-33, together with its major role in health and disease and the potential therapeutic implications of these findings in humans.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered the most common and severe form of the disease, with a median survival of approximately three years and no proven effective therapy. Despite the fact that effective treatments are absent and the precise mechanisms that drive fibrosis in most patients remain incompletely understood, an extensive body of scientific literature regarding pulmonary fibrosis has accumulated over the past 35 years. In this review, we discuss three broad areas which have been explored that may be responsible for the combination of altered lung fibroblasts, loss of alveolar epithelial cells, and excessive accumulation of ECM: inflammation and immune mechanisms, oxidative stress and oxidative signaling, and procoagulant mechanisms. We discuss each of these processes separately to facilitate clarity, but certainly significant interplay will occur amongst these pathways in patients with this disease.},

However, the mechanisms by which IL-9/Th9 mediate immunopathology in the lung are unknown. Here we report an IL-9-driven positive feedback loop that reinforces allergic inflammation. We show that IL-9 increases IL-2 production by mast cells, which leads to expansion of CD25+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and subsequent activation of Th9 cells. Blocking IL-9 or inhibiting CD117 (c-Kit) signalling counteracts the pathogenic effect of the described IL-9-mast cell-IL-2 signalling axis. Overproduction of IL-9 is observed in expectorates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and a sex-specific variant of IL-9 is predictive of allergic reactions in female patients. Our results suggest that blocking IL-9 may be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate inflammation associated with microbial colonization in the lung, and offers a plausible explanation for gender differences in clinical outcomes of patients with CF.},

abstract = {Leptin is reported to be involved in acute lung injury (ALI). However, the role and underlying mechanisms of leptin in ALI remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether leptin deficiency promoted the development of ALI. LPS or oleic acid (OA) were administered to wild-type and leptin deficient (ob/ob) mice to induce ALI. Leptin level, survival rate, and lung injury were examined. Results showed that leptin levels were predominantly increased in the lung, but also in the heart, liver, kidney, and adipose tissue after LPS adminiatration. Compared with wild-type mice, LPS- or OA-induced lung injury was worse and the survival rate was lower in ob/ob mice. Moreover, leptin deficiency promoted the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Exogenous administration of leptin reduced lethality in ob/ob mice and ameliorated lung injury partly through inhibiting the activation of NF-$\kappa$B, p38, and ERK pathways. These results indicated that leptin deficiency contributed to the development of lung injury by enhancing inflammatory response, and a high level of leptin improved survival and protected against ALI.},

abstract = {Animal cell culture technology has advanced significantly over the last few decades and is now generally considered a reliable, robust and relatively mature technology. A range of biotherapeutics are currently synthesized using cell culture methods in large scale manufacturing facilities that produce products for both commercial use and clinical studies. The robust implementation of this technology requires optimization of a number of variables, including (1) cell lines capable of synthesizing the required molecules at high productivities that ensure low operating cost; (2) culture media and bioreactor culture conditions that achieve both the requisite productivity and meet product quality specifications; (3) appropriate on-line and off-line sensors capable of providing information that enhances process control; and (4) good understanding of culture performance at different scales to ensure smooth scale-up. Successful implementation also requires appropriate strategies for process development, scale-up and process characterization and validation that enable robust operation and ensure compliance with current regulations. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the art technology in key aspects of cell culture, e.g., generation of highly productive cell lines and optimization of cell culture process conditions. We also summarize the current thinking on appropriate process development strategies and process advances that might affect process development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the quantitation of disease severity using pulmonary function tests is often confounded by emphysema. We have identified the composite physiologic index (CPI) most closely reflecting the morphologic extent of pulmonary fibrosis. Consecutive patients with a clinical/computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 212) were divided into group I (n = 106) and group II (n = 106). The CPI was derived in group I (by fitting pulmonary function tests against disease extent on CT) and was tested in Group II. The formula for the CPI was as follows: extent of disease on CT = 91.0 - (0.65 x percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) - (0.53 x percent predicted FVC) + (0.34 x percent predicted FEV1). In group II, the CPI correlated more strongly with disease extent on CT (r2 = 0.51) than the individual pulmonary function test (DLCO the highest value, r2 = 0.38). A subanalysis demonstrated that the better fit of the CPI was ascribable to a correction of the confounding effects of emphysema. Mortality was predicted more accurately by the CPI than by a pulmonary function test in all clinical subgroups, including a separate cohort of 36 patients with histologically proven usual interstitial pneumonia (CPI, p {\textless} 0.0005; FVC, p = 0.002; PO2, p = 0.002). In conclusion, a new CPI, derived against CT and validated using split sample testing, is a more accurate prognostic determinant in usual interstitial pneumonia than an individual pulmonary function test.},

The accurate identification and enumeration of these subsets are essential for understanding their role in lung pathology. Flow cytometry is a mainstream tool for studying the immune system. However, a systematic flow cytometric approach to identify subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) accurately and consistently in the normal mouse lung has not been described. Here we developed a panel of surface markers and an analysis strategy that accurately identify all known populations of macrophages and DCs, and their precursors in the lung during steady-state conditions and bleomycin-induced injury. Using this panel, we assessed the polarization of lung macrophages during the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Alveolar macrophages expressed markers of alternatively activated macrophages during both acute and fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury, whereas markers of classically activated macrophages were expressed only during the acute phase. Taken together, these data suggest that this flow cytometric panel is very helpful in identifying macrophage and DC populations and their state of activation in normal, injured, and fibrotic lungs.},
