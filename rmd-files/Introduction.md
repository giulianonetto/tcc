  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a cronic, progressive, irreversible lung disease. After diagnosis, the interstitial condition commonly presents  3-5 years of life expectancy [@Wolters2018]. Alveolar damage is characterized by dilatation of the bronchi, tissue remodeling and parenchymal fibrosis which seriously impair gas exchange. The first time the current name was used it referred to radiography tests suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis of unknown etiology, although the disease had been recognized over one hundred years before - named cirrhosis of the lung at the time [@Robbins1948, @Wolters2018]. Over three decades after the nomenclature was first published, in 1976 it gained widespread use after a review article [@Wolters2018].
  
  Currently, radiographic and histopathological patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) with apparently no seccondary causes form the basis for IPF definition [@Richeldi2017]. The disease presents sporadic and familial forms. From the edges of the lungs - base and periphery -, spreads all over the pulmonary tissue causing dry cough, fatigue and dyspnea. The latter is nearly universal in the history of IPF patients and may progress over a period of years, while the first two may be absent in the early stages. Universal findings also include low diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and Bilateral Velcro-like crackles. The chest radiograph may present nonspecific changes or bilateral basal reticular abnormalities [@Lederer2018]. The difficulty of the diagnosis is illustrated by the fact that clinicians often mistake the presence of dyspnea as indicator of heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), failing to consider insterstitial lung disease, which delays IPF detection significantly.
  
  Although its cause is not clear, there is currently a recognized increase in IPF prevalence worldwide [@Wolters2018]. As a disease of aging, this may be due to population increasing phenomena, but also to recent improvements in disease recognition [@Lederer2018]. In North America and Europe, the incidence of IPF ranges from 3 to 9 cases per 100000 person-years, while South America and East Asia show less than 4 cases per 100000 person-years [@Hutchinson2015]. Assuming these numbers as conservative, a recent brazilian study tried to calculate more precise estimates for the local reality. Using data from the 2010 Brazilian National Census and rates reported by previous studies, the authors suggested annual incidence of IPF between 6.841 and 9.997 cases per 100000 people, whereas the prevalence was estimated at a range of 13.9-18.3 cases per 100000 people [@Baddini-Martinez2015]. In terms of mortility, another study estimated 1.2 deaths per 100000 people in 2010, although this is certainly an understimation as the authors limited their analysis to data from the Information Technology Department of the Brazilian Unified Health Care System (DATASUS), which does not reflect private medice practices [@Rufino2013]. It is clear, however, that Brazil's data does not oppose the world tendency of IPF prevalence increase.
